PowerBI has the same possibility to constantly take automatic data and transfer it into charts which can be by local area presented.

"Users are locked out frequently requiring assistance in e-mailing service desk for unlocks and submitting new passwords, etc. Then, due to the changes in passwords, they are likely to lock themselves out again. I understand this is largely an ""end-user"" issue, but it is a recurring issue at many sites. Perhaps lowering the threshold for the password would be helpful. A 4-digit pin is easier and more manageable for technicians than intricate password requirements (which inevitably are written down in a handy location so they can remember it thus defeating any security provided by an intricate password).  Streamlining the password / unlock request process. Is it necessary to have to contact support? Could this process not be automated using the technicians e-mail or other two factor authentication? This would eliminate the requirement to e-mail or call support. And theoretically (and I hate to sound like an MBA) but could cut costs for the service center or allow them to refocus their efforts to solving other issues.  Better access to associated PMs and WOs associated with assets and generated PM work orders. For me to look at the past PMs for a monthly generated work order, I have to go to the relevant WO, click on the equipment tab, click the equipment number, click on order history, then organize by date to find the older work orders. This is not intuitive, and with the limited access frontline supervisors and managers have to search, reports, and equipment detail, it is not feasible to search assets and draw relevant information, history, etc.  On-site supervisors and manager don't have adequate control over PM generation and Asset management meaning we have to submit asset changes to our SI7 manager to make relevant changes. This is time consuming and takes the control from the individuals with the knowledge need to be inserted and creating an unnecessary middle step to the process.  Last, if there was a way in which work orders could be generated real-time on a monitor, it could be incredibly helpful. For our sites that used used TMS CMMS system, when a work order was generated it would automatically print the order on the shop printer and we would immediately know that a WO had come in. It also gave us a physical copy to hand to technicians for them to read the relevant details, complete the assigned task, then enter the completion info into CMMS. A similar system, printed or perhaps displayed on a monitor in work areas would allow such real-time acknowledgment of entered orders. ",Feature Request/ Enhancement
"I only use the iMFM portal, not SI portal. One thing i would like to have improved in iMFM is when creating multiple self-generated completed work orders in a row.

I then have to close iMFM, log back in, and then create the new self-gen completed work order. It's a bit annoying having to do this process.

"It would be nice in the Service Provider box if you could highlight and save the name of the Provider to paste into emails instead of having to type them out, as some of them have quite long names. Currently, if you try to click on the Service Provider name, it pulls the box open to change the Service Provider.",Feature Request/ Enhancement
"Lack of consistency with keeping conductivity. It Can lack user friendly features from time to time when it comes to communicating with other vendors attached to VAWS. It gives you an option to email outside attributes but doesn't always seem to deliver messages sent. There should be a more direct communication string that lets you see important messages sent back from the vendor or that you send to them that get directed to the recipient except through an email a message attached to the work order when it's closed. Also, the client needs to have a better understanding, at times, with what work gets sent to maintenance requests and other tasks outside of our scope ",Feature Request/ Enhancement
"make it easier to navigate and pull up orders, also to get alerted if anything in new when it comes in, I am never notified and hardly use this so when i do its very difficult to understand how to alert the customer back on orders. Not user friendly at all to someone trying to use it that only uses it a couple times a year.",Feature Request/ Enhancement
"make it mandatory to have problem description along with problem location and other key details, before someone can submit a work order. make it have more steps to complete a work order so people who need the info get it an those who don't give enough will start correctly filling the request out ",Feature Request/ Enhancement
On the top of every page. If there could be a field in which you can type in a workorder number for quick search access. Sometimes im on the phone and have to type in the workorder number the client is telling me. Be say I have just done a site history search - now I have to find the drop down to get to workorder history and then type in the workorder number instead of just being able to search the workorder number from my original page. The home page/ opening page should also have this feature so I can dive into workorders as soon as i log in. ,Feature Request/ Enhancement
"Should have the facility to log incidents. Also, it is not that user friendly. ",Feature Request/ Enhancement
"SI could be improved with more functionality. If we didn't have Coupa and could do everything in SI, it would help. PO's are time consuming, price increase or decrease takes time. One stop shop would be so helpful.",Feature Request/ Enhancement
"Sit down with or do a teams meeting with a few users at our site and create, research and approve a few work orders to see how we use it and how it is not user friendly.  I will be glad to setup a few users on a teams meeting with you.  Bward@ups.com",Feature Request/ Enhancement
The interface for finding a location may be more useful if an address can be entered instead of using a series of filters. ,Feature Request/ Enhancement
"The only complaint I have is that I have to close orders on my mobile device, It would be so much easier to do all from desktop or if we have a windows based Ipad or notebook",Feature Request/ Enhancement
"There are too many windows to get the basic information on a single workorder. We wish it could be all on one.  Clients complain that have to submit workorders that it is cumbersome. They don't always choose the correct workorder because they don't know where the correct selection is located, or they dont know what to select. If they choose the wrong selection it gets routed to the wrong person and we are unaware it has been submitted. And there it sits in cyber space.  Verbige is unclear for the client. A pop up window explaining the selection, or who it gets assigned too would be helpful. ",Feature Request/ Enhancement
"There is no flexibility for changes. Most recently the challenges I am having is ""Improvements"" not included on the Excel Template. ",Feature Request/ Enhancement
"Update filters to allow to search multiple vendors. Even when a filter is built under Reporting, Reports the details do not save and multiple vendors are not saved.  To be able to use the ""Contains, Ends With, Equals, etc"" options in the drop downs.",Feature Request/ Enhancement

Payment processing is a massive inconvenience. All the options to choose from or not user-friendly. There is no updates when something has changed other than through your email please hinder and cost us valuable time.,Feature Request/ Enhancement
"Use is not intuitive. Often comments, etc. appear to be minimal or non-existent. We shouldn't have to struggle to know what's going on with a ticket. Updates are not sent to anyone on the clinic side.  We get no notification of creation of WO, changes to WO, etc.    Uploaded documents (backflow preventer documentation, fire extinguisher, etc..) should be automatically forwarded to someone within the clinic. Often these are uploaded weeks after we open tickets and we never see them if we don't remember to go back and check.  Even searching for past tickets can be difficult and frustrating as there are far too many categories of information that we have no knowledge of.",Feature Request/ Enhancement
You may have a way of doing this that I don't know about. Let's say I have a pm ID for air fan. Well that ID for that all the air fans in the building are the same. I can't get SI7 to assign the af on one floor to one tech and assign another af to a different tech automaticly. I have to send all af to myself and then assign them to my techs. Waste a lot of time.,Feature Request/ Enhancement
