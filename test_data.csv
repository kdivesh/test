PRODUCT,ANSWER_12
fmPilot2,"I have to close out, clear history and cache, and log back in multiple times a day to due to error messages and latency issues. It would be nice to not have to do that. "
fmPilot2,"Of all the information captured in a work order, not all data can be exported (i.e. who & when approved a quote; or a work order for payment). For service provider I often hear about the extra clicks to move a work order into the right status (i.e. taking a work order from IN PROGRESS to QUOTE NEEDED)."
fmPilot2,1. It logs me out after 15-ish minutes of no activity. I have to log in dozen times a day. 2. FMs shouldn't have to answer one dozen of questions when creating a WO. 3. Sometimes there is too much information and sometimes too little. 4. It stalls/crashes to many times during the day. If it does it more than once a year than it's too much.  Overall it's not bad at all but it would benefot from some fine tunning.
fmPilot2,"A ground-up rebuild would probably be best. I have most trouble with comments and email integration, navigating work order groups, having multiple tabs of fmPilot open at once confusing actions, performing bulk actions, and generally glitches and latency issues throughout the site."
fmPilot2,Less crashes.
fmPilot2,na
fmPilot2,
fmPilot2,I need to uses FMP every day. there are so many functions I don't understand.
fmPilot2,The UI and the responsiveness could be improved a bit. These are just test comments.
fmPilot2,NA
fmPilot2,Stop the errors that happen. Let us work longer without booting me out.
fmPilot2,"It keeps giving ""gray"" screens and locking up. Very time consuming to have to log out and log in for each work order. "
fmPilot2,"IT IS ONE OF THE EASIEST, MOST USER FRIENDLY FORMATS OUT THERE"
fmPilot2,"Terms used in email, phone conversation, text, page to page, clickable items, abbreviations, and acronyms, all should be the same and read the same way for everything. "
fmPilot2,easier to search for open work orders and progress to it; application will not auto fill my username/facility unless i refresh browser when adding a work order
fmPilot2,open screen should have active open worm orders not completed. portal times out 2 quickly 
fmPilot2,The comments column is much too narrow. It includes lengthy text at the bottom of emails that shouldn't be included. It adds images from emails that are unnecessary ie: logos. It adds photos from emails that have already been added to the workorder. 
fmPilot2,"It would be nice in the Service Provider box if you could highlight and save the name of the Provider to paste into emails instead of having to type them out, as some of them have quite long names. Currently, if you try to click on the Service Provider name, it pulls the box open to change the Service Provider."
fmPilot2,Takes forever to load and freezes/ crashes often
fmPilot2,no complain about it
fmPilot2,Provide exact payment dates.  It's significantly challenging to purchase needed materials to complete WOs timely when payments are made more than 30 days after completion of work order. We are expected to complete WOs timely but are not compensated timely. 
fmPilot2,"Oh boy, where to start. - Update the look and navigation functionality so it doesn't look and feel like a website from 2003 - Make it so the program doesn't have all sorts of weird bugs whenever more than one tab is open, or in general - Search function is incredibly limited - Alignment between searchable criteria and exportable data - Revamp the way you communicate through the platform (i.e. comment vs. email comment) - Customizable notification settings for individual users or groups of users on individual or groups of work orders"
fmPilot2,"Our company tends to get a lot of system errors and long load times. Photos often get corrupted when being uploaded, quotes lengths cause issues for larger jobs/longer descriptions, and some punctuation causes issues in line items. We also run into many instances where the save option does not work when quoting and we have to re-load in a separate tab then re-enter all  items in order to save. "
fmPilot2,"Can we have an easy way to see a history of updates made to location data. To my knowledge it is currently impossible to see when the address of a location changed, and this can be important information to have. Related, can all providers in a location's matrix get an automatic email informing them of address changes?"
fmPilot2,There seems to be issues where my page keeps getting frozen on a grey screen and i have to refresh often until the page loads. There are also some issues when i have multiple work orders open on different tabs and a comment that i place in one work order gets placed on a completely different work order
fmPilot2,"Easier layout, too cluttered with complicated menus."
fmPilot2,"Allow me to open and notate multiple work orders simultaneously. Currently, fmPilot will only allow you to notate the work order that was opened last. fmPilot is also often slow and buggy. For example, if you make a mistake while building a quote, you are no longer able to save your correction, and you are forced to start the quote all over again. This is very frustrating when you've already input numerous line items. "
fmPilot2,"allow uploads to be deleted if neccessary -have people actually read the comments  -give contact info as to who to contact if have issues with the web#  - have a few more choices under Remedy/Cause, example- needs an electrician"
fmPilot2,Needs improvements in navigation aspect and resetting search when navigating to different sections
fmPilot2,Have a report where I can see when we are getting paid
fmPilot2,"The work description is limited to 2048, which is very short to explain the issues, describe the steps, and set a recommendation."
fmPilot2,There are way too many disruptions. The system crashes too much.
fmPilot2,"I am not continually in the system during my work day, it's one of the multiple tools that I use....the need to log back in seems quite frequent in comparison to other systems we run.   "
fmPilot2,"Fix the lag issue when opening work order attachments.  Also, I sometimes need to refresh my browser several times to get a page to load.  Not sure if the latter is a platform issue or a Chrome issue, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention."
fmPilot2,N/A
fmPilot2,the program is easy to work-  Consistent across customers.  The calls from the associates are non helpful.  Those calling tend to be rude & very unhelpful.  Usually is seems to be a blind call getting the incorrect person & the caller is too hurried to give the information actually needed to get them in touch with the correct person
fmPilot2,"put some areas that we can filter via region, like EAST or WEST region."
fmPilot2,better
fmPilot2,"When I put in an EMERGENCY repair order and, six days later, I still haven't received a service call or even a phone call, I'd say major improvement is needed."
fmPilot2,"Quotes should be uploaded so we at the facility see what the vendor is quoting for work.  When written communications are sent, the person entering the order and/or the person listed as secondary contact is included.  Vendor be held accountable for uploading reports quickly - their invoices are held until they have completed this step - we are have requirements to have documentation on file for annual services.  We have to keep checking back on the work order for months sometimes waiting for the reports to show up."
fmPilot2,It is very difficult to enter work orders.  Most times the website is glitchy and i cannot select my location and therefore cannot enter a non-emergency workorder.
fmPilot2,"It does not work more than 95% of the time.  It does not load completely, and you have to refresh the pages more than 5 times to get it to load fully."
fmPilot2,"Website if often glitchy, can be hard to find open work orders. A lot of back and forth happens before something can actually get addressed, can be a bit frustrating. "
fmPilot2,"Update filters to allow to search multiple vendors. Even when a filter is built under Reporting, Reports the details do not save and multiple vendors are not saved.  To be able to use the ""Contains, Ends With, Equals, etc"" options in the drop downs."
fmPilot2,Wish there was and (other) in the request type.
fmPilot2,The App doesn't work out in the work field. The app doesn't let you search by site name or filter by site name. The web work orders never have the correct dates on them. Work orders disappear before anything can be loaded to it.
fmPilot2,No comment
fmPilot2,Pretty good over all
fmPilot2,Please improve the speed. Thanks.
fmPilot2,When doing the quote always get timed out and have to reenter parts. Very time consuming. Make it so you are not timed out when doing quotes. 
fmPilot2,"FM pilot does not have a dispatch board and is not  fast enough for the high caliber , fast pace account we have.  Its functions do not meet our accounts needs. It is slow , to many clicks to get where you need to go and it does not function as it should . For years now it still does not function for our account with times down , upgrades that happen always take down our program down the following day.  Over all it slows down my job performance all together. In my opinion it cost us money if we can't manage the Urgency for the clinic , our client or team to assist in managing the Work orders effectively. "
fmPilot2,when I get in t o make a work order it takes a few times for it to connect
fmPilot2,"There are only issues when the app goes down. The IVR phone line is very unpredictable, sometimes it wont recognize check ins and we need to check in again when we're checking out, thus the time onsite isn't recorded. The app is fanatstic.  "
fmPilot2,"I would like to see a way to search for specific types of comments on the comment screen.  For example: Search for all vendor comments, search for all internal comments, Search for all Dispatch comments, Search for all Reject comments. "
fmPilot2,Keep the dialogue box open if user is needing to hop to another tab File uploading needs to be more streamlined
fmPilot2,comments being reviewed before reaching out. possibly a feature that shows the latest update to assist with that.
fmPilot2,"It runs very slow, and there are lots of glitches"
fmPilot2,Pending Site update quicker
fmPilot2,"I think it's great, but when using filters, it would be great if we could exclude a trade."
fmPilot2,Reports generating are not user friendly. 
fmPilot2,Fix the Grey screen (timeout) which would save a lot of time not having to refresh frequently. 
fmPilot2,photos don't upload  properly with out lines through them - and all emails don't auto generate. 
fmPilot2,I had to restart the application >5 times to input information. The application is very slow.
fmPilot2,Things that would be helpful: *Ability to select multiple work orders and send one message or perform one function. *More intuitive flow between status updates. *Ability to have multiple fmPilot windows open at one time. 
fmPilot2,When using filters please make it so we can go back a page without having to refresh and start all over again. 
fmPilot2,Details in the comment section.
fmPilot2,Fix all glitches and make it easier to navigate.
fmPilot2,"Make it facility specific when logging into the app vs the entire division/village's WOs listed.  It's time consuming filtering away the unnecessary details of other facilities work orders to find your own WOs.  Also, do not CLOSE a work order until the entire order is complete, ie. I placed a facility refresh request into the system in 2022 for the 2023 Refresh project and it was closed and nothing has been completed in the WO."
fmPilot2,Fix latency issues.
fmPilot2,Nothing at this time
fmPilot2,I would like to see detailed updates on the time from when an invoice is approved and when the payment is made to the vendor. 
fmPilot2,IMPROVE SPEED 
fmPilot2,I'm comfortable using FMPilot. I have no suggestions.
fmPilot2,Not having to refresh so often. 
fmPilot2,Make quote templates the user can build on. 
fmPilot2,"1. When putting in a quote the sytem times out and you lose all of the information, it is very aggrevating 2. It  goes down on a regular basis 3. There is no one to call when there is an issue that needs to be resolved, we know of no tech support 4. You cannot have more tabs open up at the same time 5. Work orders don't always come to our emails, causing us to miss emergency work orders 6. File size limitations for uploads  7. There is no training for new employees 8. The screen goes blank, having to reload over and over  "
fmPilot2,The program is one of the worst I've ever used. Constant crashes and error messages daily. This platform needs to be completly overhauled and fixed. The amount of times I have to close out and log back into the program slows me down so much and I can hardly get anything done.  
fmPilot2,No suggestions at this time
fmPilot2,"When a technician is using FM Pilot to check inout, they should be able to add notes stating what they did. "
fmPilot2,updates and latency
fmPilot2,"It would be nice if it would refresh itself every 2min or so. Would like to have the ability to upload, Manf, Model and Serial Numbers of equipment being worked on."
fmPilot2,"The load times for the website are extremely long, to the point that it will not pull up information unless the page is refreshed multiple times."
fmPilot2,the latency
fmPilot2,"I have to refresh the page 3-4 times every time I change the WO status or put in a comment or save the WO. Quote must be uploaded with taxes should be mentioned under the Finance tab in a place where it is visible to the Service Provider while adding the quote. Currently it is in fine print at the bottom of the quote. None of the vendors actually read those fine prints. Different status must have an explanation where the client, CBRE employee or anyone using FMP can easily understand the meaning of what the abbreviations mean. FMP should be more user friendly"
fmPilot2,More statuses
fmPilot2,"Please extend deadlines for SLA, such as extending the 24 hours for a quote. "
fmPilot2, make it easier to find all jobs at the same location to verify history. 
fmPilot2,Se traba seguido
fmPilot2,Start up window does not allow you to fill out boxes. You have to back out and go back in before you can move through the form. I spent 10 minutes trying to make it go forward. finally got mad and backed out! when I went back in I could finish the form.
fmPilot2,Make it work without issue over all web browsers.  For both sides of the WO.  Please.
fmPilot2,checking in and out
fmPilot2,Make it easier to integrate with external service management software
fmPilot2,I am not sure
fmPilot2,Less latency issues.
fmPilot2,"minimal to no latency, if possible to include what is the code for like in the FMpilot 1 and for accounts like sally beauty and Tforce (new interface) have an option to open WO history even without searching the store first just like the account like pepboys and GNC because we need to check duplicate WO but with those account we cannot do that while creating WO "
fmPilot2,FMP constantly kicks you out. You have to always keep refreshing when trying to create a child work order or view any work order for that matter.
fmPilot2,"Know the HVAC Units and their parts before rejecting Invoices for things out of our control.  Example: A Direct Drive Unit does not have belts, but we get rejections for no belt photos ALL THE TIME."
fmPilot2,nothing working good 
fmPilot2,not sure
fmPilot2,"FMpilot is easy to use until there are issues. It becomes extremely difficult when you are experiencing slowness or in some cases the screen freezing. But when it is running, it's easy to use. "
fmPilot2,Make the reports easier
fmPilot2,Make it where 2 people cant be in the same work order at the same time and make alterations. It messes things up. Should have a message that pops up indicating if someone is in WO. 
fmPilot2,"There seems to be a constant delay when loading screens. Oftentimes, it is necessary to refresh the screen several times before the screen loads. another aspect that could use improvement is the ability to select the data you would like to extract in reports instead of a blanket data set that is pulled when running a report.  Having the ability to select the data you need would be beneficial.  "
fmPilot2,Not sure
fmPilot2,Fix it
fmPilot2,Enhancement updates
fmPilot2,I think after getting to know fmPilot it is a great site to use. 
fmPilot2,needs more options for like when people reject a quote or want a revised quote and leave it in quote rejected
fmPilot2,Having to reload the page constantly techs in the field have had troubles loading the page and accessing their WOs 
fmPilot2,Page times out to soon. Also more room in scope of work would be very helpful.
fmPilot2,Had to load in twice. First time came up with wrong location listed and would not accept my email as valid. Once I exited and reloaded the page everything was fine. 
fmPilot2,would help to have stores email address in all jobs and also nicole warner's email address noted.  these 2 addresses have to be manually entered 
fmPilot2,I wish there is something to be doner in order for the fmP to work faster like it should be. Thank you.
fmPilot2,Add more filters
fmPilot2,"ES FACIL DE USAR, CONSIDERO DE MOMENTO ESTA SENCILLA. "
fmPilot2,Searching is awkward and slow
fmPilot2,"Make it more USER FRIENDLY.   The facilities have difficulty finding the correct coding to enter NON EMER work orders.  Some of the codes the support center uses all the time are not available to them...so they enter just about everything as General Maint, --which is not good.   Give the facilities instruction, easy instruction on how to use it.   That would make support center staff work easier instead of having to fix the mistakes of others before service is rendered.  "
fmPilot2,none
fmPilot2,Too many glitches - moves slow. Takes forever to enter a quote and then it freezes and you have to restart unless you save every 5 seconds. You shouldnt have to reenter a quote for the invoice. Too old school 
fmPilot2,There are not enough choices for issues
fmPilot2,"System lags, especially when using the Tracking (Bus);  Would be nice to see all the IVR on the main screen without having to drill down(space available if comment box removed from Main Screen);  Include Primary Email contact in the Comment Email Contact Box  as standard default "
fmPilot2,Stop the spinning and latency issues
fmPilot2,More definitive user roles and less latency issues.
fmPilot2,"It's literally the worst CMMS I've ever used.  From frequent crashes, ""spinning wheel of death"", buttons not working at different times, comments not logging, etc. it's just very unreliable.  I have a team of techs that are constantly dealing with login issues, can't get into work orders, geolocation isn't working.  My vendors complain constantly about having to use it.  Before I make a recommendation for changes to be made, the whole program needs to be made more reliable.  That's it.  Make it work right."
fmPilot2,Make the reporting features easier to navigate to generate the needed reports
fmPilot2,"Allow date/time, work order status change, and/or changes to priority, NTE to all save at once without having to update individually. "
fmPilot2,"Most of the extended search features don't come in handy.  Would be helpful if we could just search by Store name or Location #.  Currently, we have to know the CBRE client code and whether there are zeros in front of the location # to search.  The WO# search feature is helpful but sometimes we don't have that # so the store name would be helpful. Would be helpful if there were 2 columns of work orders, one showing the default that is visible now and then one for the in progress work orders."
fmPilot2,faster updates between the IFM and FMP2 
fmPilot2,status updates
fmPilot2,It needs to be more user friendly
fmPilot2,"Use is not intuitive. Often comments, etc. appear to be minimal or non-existent. We shouldn't have to struggle to know what's going on with a ticket. Updates are not sent to anyone on the clinic side.  We get no notification of creation of WO, changes to WO, etc.    Uploaded documents (backflow preventer documentation, fire extinguisher, etc..) should be automatically forwarded to someone within the clinic. Often these are uploaded weeks after we open tickets and we never see them if we don't remember to go back and check.  Even searching for past tickets can be difficult and frustrating as there are far too many categories of information that we have no knowledge of."
fmPilot2,Constantly have to refresh a ton because it wont load.   Half the time it wont let me create a work order- I have to refresh and make it 3 plus times before it actually takes
fmPilot2,To be able to have to correct information and the necessary resources to contact the person or person in charge of the account. I don't understand that when you guys need some information you will call and CC the whole company. 
fmPilot2,Slowness is the only issue. 
fmPilot2,Updated software. 
fmPilot2,Use a usable UI. Also most calls come in at 1 o'clock and we are 2 hours from going into overtime already.
fmPilot2,"Update equipment on the work orders when we submit them. Way too many glitches in this system, wont save information on 1st try. Have to re enter and try to save over and over until system finally retains info. "
fmPilot2,Entering quotes & invoices is difficult at times because of how we operate with the client. This system was not built for companies like us. It would be nice also if you could be able to download multiple photos at one time and delete attachments if you upload something incorrect by mistake. 
fmPilot2,need some kind of notation that notes have been added to open reqs. so we know to look at them or respond
fmPilot2,it's just difficult finding things on the site
fmPilot2,Don't make too many changes if you choose to make improvements! :)
fmPilot2,"I need to get history on equipment and have no way without asset information in FMP Filters could be more useful, such as ""not Including"" "
fmPilot2,No suggestions
fmPilot2,"It's not possible to move a quote that includes labor to the invoice screen without rekeying. Would be great to have all of that flow through.  Also have issues with labor rates not being preloaded and when that occurs, we are unable to use the Labor line item in invoicing b/c we can't override the labor rate to fix the issue.   "
fmPilot2,Better communication between fmpilot and vender
fmPilot2,My clinic doesn't pop up when I first sign in.  I can't search for it.  I have to sign in multiple times before my clinic pops up
fmPilot2,esta bien
fmPilot2,contact information for raising an NTE or speaking with a rep. 
fmPilot2,Make the email updates relevant and timely.  Dispatch to vendors sooner.  No reason a ticket should take several weeks to get an update on.
fmPilot2,"I need a Dashboard, I need a Flag when service doesn't arrive on time.  How can we capture these delayed responses?"
fmPilot2,ancering the telephone more frequently
fmPilot2,I think its harder to find your older tickets and the calendar almost never works for us. 
fmPilot2,speed
fmPilot2,"It is easy to use once you get used to where everything is at.  The overall site appears a bit outdated, but its features have improved since we started using FM Pilot.    "
fmPilot2,Possibly a choice of doors
fmPilot2, It can be very glitchy and slow at times- Also the client side only works on firefox. 
fmPilot2,more useful and relevant help links 
fmPilot2,Having the ability to delete attachments would be great -- PLEASE!!  (your own attachments of course not customer or site uploads) THANK YOU!! :)
fmPilot2,It feels a bit busy...a little more white space would make it easier to read and work through.
fmPilot2,fmPilot is not user friendly to get started. Once you learn everything it seems easier.
fmPilot2,"please add the store Mgrs email addresses and also Nicole Warner's to listing when making ""comments"" to email direct."
fmPilot2,its very easy to use
fmPilot2,"The techs have the most difficult time using the app out in the field, so singing in and out is a job in itself. It is absolutely impossible to effectively keep track of the status of daily work orders because every work order is just thrown on a never-ending list. I have to have a sperate worksheet because the system has this terrible color-coded thing were the colors look the same and I have to have a chart just to try and figure out the status of a work order. "
fmPilot2,pay faster - its about cash flow and I am still waiting on payment for Jobs we did in July.   The best vendors have the ability to pick and choose who they work for not wait or beg for payment.  I work with multiple third party payers and CBRE is the slowest to pay.   Also communicate when bills will be paid.
fmPilot2,Give super users mpore access
fmPilot2,"why can fmPilot not work in all browsers?  Why are some functions not available while using specific browsers?  Trying to find the ""correct"" browsers to use to do my job can be difficult and time consuming for little to no reason."
fmPilot2,"make it easier to navigate and pull up orders, also to get alerted if anything in new when it comes in, I am never notified and hardly use this so when i do its very difficult to understand how to alert the customer back on orders. Not user friendly at all to someone trying to use it that only uses it a couple times a year."
fmPilot2,"When I first log on to select clinic it often comes up with clinic location 0 and will not allow me to move forward until I close it and reopen. Closed WO that  are not completed, would like to have a notification of events so a follow-up could be completed "
fmPilot2,"make is easier to put invoices in, be able to log in from the workorder online"
fmPilot2,more options to choose from
fmPilot2,"Meet with the FedEx business team, Fred Lachance and Brad Courtney to make additional changes to better serve your customer. "
fmPilot2,Nothing its amazing
fmPilot2,This portal has too many complicated processes for submitting one invoice
fmPilot2,todo muy bien
fmPilot2,I don't know
fmPilot2,Placing fmPilot on the V dashboard would really make it more convenient. 
fmPilot2,It times out to quickly; lately there has been a lot of issues with the IVR and techs can't check in/out.  Overall it isn't user friendly. 
fmPilot2,I don't know if the problem is fmPilot or CBRE but cannot seem to get anything fixed or accomplished.
fmPilot2,Less forms and attachments
fmPilot2,Allow access to view date/time when work order statuses were changed.
fmPilot2,Not for me
fmPilot2,"We need a ""pinned"" comment, we need an additional radio button like the ""emg"" button (need to be able to denote in IFM that there is no water, or no restroom, or no HVAC, et c- right now it's too generic with the RCs and no configurable field to report on for these urgent issues). The assets from client side need to be integrated. The new UI is incredibly unfriendly and the tracking is impossible to navigate.  "
fmPilot2,Making it easier to submit different quotes for the location that has nothing to do with the initial issue at hand. 
fmPilot2,Check in check out is difficult when we have no service. It also has been difficult signing into a job and it keeps saying to many errors.   Something to improve on is the option list menu making it easier to navigate and sort the work orders.
fmPilot2,Please improve the system it is so slow in opening up the system.  
fmPilot2,Make it easier to communicate with support / AP / team leaders etc.
fmPilot2,Not make the page so busy. Less is more
fmPilot2,I'm still good with the interface but could have some improvements with the correct trade match from client-side to IFM to avoid rework.
fmPilot2,"Make searching work orders easier, showing current work orders that are open without the need in filtering it to show it."
fmPilot2,"Sometimes the FMP is slow and is affecting our work, hoping for that not to happened again."
fmPilot2,Make it easier to search for work orders and make it easier to add users.
fmPilot2,The newest Fmpilot page format does not like to load often. You have to refresh it a couple times each time you access a client that has the new format in order to get it open 
fmPilot2,  Not sure
fmPilot2,"The website is slow a buggy. As a company we often times have issues submitting quotes. When we are logged out due to inactivity it takes a long time to get logged back in and sometimes when we log back in, our accounts are not listed so we have to log out and log back in again. I'm not a fan."
fmPilot2,Sometimes glitchy but otherwise a good working platform.  Rarely do we have payment issues which is good.
fmPilot2,not that user friendly
fmPilot2,Data extraction is not always accurate 
fmPilot2,Communication with facility. So many different technicians from different agencies. Maybe a follow up call or email to the AA  so she can expect a certain agency instead of one agency today and another tomorrow and nobody knows what to do or when to do it. Mass confusion  here on work orders.
fmPilot2,"It would be helpful to be able to know more about the status of various requests, what progress, or where in the process FM is. For example, we have submitted a number of requests over the years to have an old walk-behind forklift removed (it does not work), but have never seen any movement on it. Anyway, you have been very responsive to our various other requests that, and I do appreciate it."
fmPilot2,"Better, faster, more flexible interface. This version needs to be scratched and updated. Not fun dealing with CBRE employees. It leaves a bland, bad taste in the mouth. "
fmPilot2,NOT a user-friendly platform. The page is often slow or unavailable. Even moving through the process to submit a quote or proposal is clunky.
fmPilot2,It doesn't flow very easily. It glitches quite a bit
fmPilot2,"I love using fmPilot when it likes to work properly.  It is common to run into issues throughout the day where when you are logged in moving from screen to screen it likes to just sit and spin and not load in a timely manner.  I could refresh up to 15 times sometimes to get it to load the next screen or WO.  It is very frustrating but when it works, its a great program.  "
fmPilot2,improve its latency
fmPilot2,New store locations are not in the system in a timely manner.  Service providers are not listed for  Painting tasks.  There is only one option for most stores.  Photos need to be able to be sent to Service Channel and back from FMP.  I spend too much of my day uploading and downloading pictures that don't automatically share between both programs.
fmPilot2,can we remove the character limit in the description field?
fmPilot2,Very slow most of the times. Lots of issues. Please fix it. It's affecting our work.
fmPilot2,I'd like it to be easier to go between locations.  I have to click location dashboard to then be able to search another site.   I do that a lot more often than actually searching by a workorder number.  
fmPilot2,"The website functions, but is very unfriendly for a user. It would be great if you could open work orders without losing your previous screen and having to re fill in all your search filters. Submitting a quote is always made difficult because if you mess something up (such as too many characters in description or hitting save without a line-item having a description) you lose all your progress and cannot save the quote again, requiring you to start over. The quotes should be able to populate into invoices directly. Communications on the software should appear in a communication box, making it easier to access communications, these communications could appear in a pop up box - like a notification on an iPhone. The website functions properly and my team has integrated to be able to use it, but our jobs are routinely made more difficult because the fmPilot software is not very user friendly/streamlined."
fmPilot2,Satisfied
fmPilot2,It can run a little slow sometimes
fmPilot2,More details needed.
fmPilot2,Not create an issue every time its updated.
fmPilot2,The speed of the system and onboard RAM needs to be improved and documents like Spend Authority should be integrated into the system.
fmPilot2,Calling the IVR system makes getting crews clocked in / out quite difficult as the system does not allow enough time to get the web # entered and ends the call.  
fmPilot2,the website is slow and requires multiple refreshes even with my optic fibre.
fmPilot2,looks like a website from 2002. needs to make updated status more streamlined as well as adding attachments and updating. 
fmPilot2,Nothing comes to mind currently
fmPilot2,live agent
fmPilot2,"It would be helpful if after a quote is approved and work is completed, if the portal was able to transfer quoted entries over to invoice, this would eliminate multiple entries for the break down. "
fmPilot2,:-)
fmPilot2,I would find it easier to use fmPilot if I didn't have to guess what category my work order falls under. Sometimes what I need isn't listed in the category options and I have to put it under General Maintenance/Non-emergency. It would also be nice to make emergency work orders on the website instead of calling them in. 
fmPilot2,Too difficult to move around....have to click on too many things just to approve or reject items.  Response time is slow.
fmPilot2,I use to mainly enter quotes. it is dreadfully slow to select a topic.  ...... then enter..... then wait...... then put in each line 
fmPilot2,It is sometimes very restrictive.  It would be very helpful if we could invoice for the current job and quote for future work separately.  
fmPilot2,"it is not a user friendly portal. the layout, the buttons at the top, the changing status.  Corrigo is a much easy portal to use. Trying to quote in FM Pilot gives people stress. "
fmPilot2,The app
fmPilot2,"The largest challenge with utilizing fmP2 is the latency and/or system crashes - it is frequent enough (several times a week) that it impacts productivity and performance for myself, my team, and our client. It often results in escalations to a corporate level (several times a month) when they report that they want to use the system but get frustrated with the time spent trying to get it to load correctly.  All are aware to try different browsers to see what works best for them + the recommendation to clear cache/cookies daily to increase performance but it would be nice to be able to eliminate the need for these additional tasks. If there is any opportunity to get this challenge turned around, I think that would eliminate a significant portion (if not all) the frustration the team and client sees with using this system. "
fmPilot2,More user friendly 
fmPilot2,I DON'T HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS
fmPilot2,I have no suggestions
fmPilot2,"not very easy to visually look at, not very user friendly"
fmPilot2,"Mostly it's just outdated and buggy. The new UI for example rarely works. You have to constantly clear your cache and refresh the page several times to get it to fully load. I prefer working in the old UI, even if it is outdated.  The most difficult part of fmPilot is the quoting and invoicing forms, though. Markups process incorrectly. Often times there's a phantom empty line item you can't remove, which adds an extra markup to client costs. For any remotely complex job, the description field doesn't let you adequately describe it due to the character limits."
fmPilot2,"For the past month or so, our techs have been unable to log in and/or out of the IVR. I called to report this and I was told they did not have any other complaints [not sure what that has to do with checking into or correcting a malfunction] It is still not functioning correctly Thank you "
fmPilot2,"-Addition of a ""next follow up date"" field to indicate when the work order should be actioned next to be set by the coordinator assigned to that work order -Ability to choose what data points will export -Not uploading photos from emails sent outside of the work order to the attachments (providers email signature logos upload several times over) -Loading contact information for account team based on client so providers can quickly select our team email address when emailing updates -Improved load times on work order tracking, work order over 30 days old or with a lot of updates take a very long time to load -Ability to copy and paste a string of work order numbers into the data stripe search feature instead of going to user filters -Utilizing vendor profile information to include contact information based on trade, client account, time of day etc -Utilizing vendor schedules for holidays or other days they close so they do not have dispatches sitting with them when they are closed -Link to submit MAC ticket with in work order and work order details autofilled -Cleaner view of work order comments page, depending on length of data in other columns, the ""body"" column can become very narrow with only a few words per line making it difficult read and see multiple comments at once -Improved duplicate and recall identification when dispatching work orders  "
fmPilot2,The ability to be able to resubmit a quote after it's been rejected without having to email someone to reopen 
fmPilot2,To adjust invoice after submitting it
fmPilot2,Stop the lagging
fmPilot2,"If a proposal is approved, there should be an option to get it to automatically populate the invoice fields to match. It seems like certain WOs just get stalled or lost in between somewhere and take way way too long to get paid.  There are too many different statuses and they are hard to decipher. Users should be able to delete attachments. "
fmPilot2,Streamline the quote process. A create proposal button or add quote. Just seems like there are a lot of processes to go through to upload a quote.
fmPilot2,New UI doesn't always load. Agent have issues putting in work orders too. FXE is a good example.
fmPilot2,n/a
fmPilot2,"When copying quotes to invoice (line items) it always includes the ""STANDARD -- STANDARD--"" writing in the description. Give visibility to clients when a vendor updates the scheduled ETA date."
fmPilot2,WORKS FINE 
fmPilot2,"Details should be provided in column for specific things. Like Project, Purchase items, Quantity and Cost"
fmPilot2,"seems like I'm always having issues invoicing from my phone, also when I check in and out it never gives enough time to punch in the correct info and says you exceeded the time allowed"
fmPilot2,Constantly difficult access-I have to open and close it twice in order to get the correct facility.  The system asks for answers to be repeated and the drop downs are difficult to navigate.  
fmPilot2,"This platform is not user friendly- searching for a site is difficult, searching for anything is difficult.  inputting financial lines is difficult.  "
fmPilot2,Fix bugs and improve speed. 
fmPilot2,All good
fmPilot2,cant think of anything
fmPilot2,"fmPilot varies in performance. Sometimes it is very difficult to make client side updates or create work orders. Also, certain times fmpilot will just spin and not do anything. Performance needs to be better. "
fmPilot2,Try to cut down on the redundancy of repeating the same question several times to complete a process.  IE:  when invoicing for example. I have to put the job description in several areas and attach an invoice with the same description on it.
fmPilot2,Too much having to go to the actions tab and select an option from the accepting a WO to invoicing it.
fmPilot2,i am using this a few weeks so I need more time to observe what to improve on this tool.
fmPilot2,"I believe the initial navigation of the application could be a little better. Many times I have top search classifications to find the right one to submit for repair. Example: Cleaning homeless debris on the property should not be classified as ""additional sweeping"""
fmPilot2,it should be scrapped.
fmPilot2,"as we are new to this system , we are still learning, as with anything else it gets easier the more  WO we complete.  But I do find that when I reach out for help in the later hours of the afternoon it is ,more difficult to get a hold of anyone to ask questions."
fmPilot2,"Reduce the amount of clicks, its always buffering. "
fmPilot2,no improvements needed
fmPilot2,Decreased latency
fmPilot2,more work 
fmPilot2,"Update system to recognize the person logging in. I have been having trouble with that since inception, despite multiple requests for assistance."
fmPilot2,Continued follow-up with those work orders that are taking longer to complete. 
fmPilot2,respond quicker
fmPilot2,"It is extremely SLOW and difficult to navigate. Not user friendly, difficult to search jobs, communicate with PMs, update info as needed, etc... "
fmPilot2,Nothing
fmPilot2,no issues
fmPilot2,There are too many options to toggle through screens. Things should be streamlined for easy access to know your work order count and current status. 
fmPilot2,"Make it work correctly, program often operates  slow , locks up and kicks you out a lot , and ETC."
fmPilot2,I found the system to be working just fine. No adjustments I can think of right now
fmPilot2,1. It feels buggy sometimes when trying to edit/submit invoices or quotes. Will just get stuck and doesn't give good responses on what the issues are.  2. There's no option to request for a raise in DNE.
fmPilot2,Stop trying to tweak it and add features.  Leave it alone.  Hire people who actually know how to code!!!
fmPilot2,Just need better scorecard tracking catagories
fmPilot2,I constantly have to refresh my browser 5plus times to get the page to load. It took me 20 plus minutes to create a work order on several occasions because it would not load and create the work order and then I have to refresh restart the work order process over and over again. I have tried on several web browsers.
fmPilot2,"Add the DM and manager email to the Associated User list.  Thks, Tam SM 2106"
fmPilot2,"we as managers use the FM pilot and desktop version, the App is a different set up. I would like to see a way to access the app better for managers to see what the techs see to help make sure clients and info can be accessed better. The downloads and uploaded forms are not visible to the field techs. "
fmPilot2,Make updating password be a little easier to obtain
fmPilot2,"Make the UX more friendly, and clearer."
fmPilot2,Taylor it for each business unit. 
fmPilot2,"It would be better if we could contact someone easier when something happens.  Also, The system isn't very user friendly.  It should have more warning pop ups when something is missing or different.  Thank you."
fmPilot2,Loading times are slow. It's very buggy and glitchy and performance improvements don't seem to make big differences. It's a great site and platform but unreliable at times.
fmPilot2,Less lag or latency issues would make fmpilot easier to use
fmPilot2,im not sure but need to be easyer on fallow-up
fmPilot2,often jobs are marked completed when they are not
fmPilot2,Not easy to work with
fmPilot2,"Easy to use and enter what is needed, take the time out of having to call in the workorder."
fmPilot2,"Can we make the website more use frendily, of creating a WO and attaching the file at the same time."
fmPilot2,"When we call for check-in as a vendor, we do not have enough time to input the numbers, we have to repeat several times until is ok, same for check-out"
fmPilot2,"Include email communication with critical changes/status updates to the store.  For instance, we have a toilet leak.  The repairman came.  He ordered a part but didn't return on the date he stated.  Several days after that stated return date, FM Pilot updated the status."
fmPilot2,FMPILOT works fine for us and easy to use. 
fmPilot2,Seria perfecto no hicieran tantas preguntas y cuando reportas algo vengan rapido a reparar las cosas. 
fmPilot2,"sometimes it takes me 10 tries to ad a work order, please make this function easier to use!!!!"
fmPilot2,It is too hard to check the status of a work order. The issuer/customer cannot make comments on the work order. 
fmPilot2,FIX BULK INVOICING.
fmPilot2,a better way to mas upload invoices.  Your current report is way too touchy and not user friendly.  Most of the time the ones who submit invoices are data crunchers and end users not IT gurus 
fmPilot2,"Fix the website. Specially for the other clients, it's loading very slowly and sometimes it won't open."
fmPilot2,CBRE to dial back the spam calling and emails . Spending more team on admin / emails than in-field monitoring . This will help big time in service 
fmPilot2,"Uploading documents easier -Having all team emails preloaded  -Simplifying quoting page -When CBRE emails and we reply to emails Having all responses automatically go into portal -making a simplified note page- where we need CB to take action or we are proactively updating -scheduling on calendar easier without Having to then save work order as well. -creating a return trip needed IVR status (When techs need to return to continue work, but already have materials)- we are told not to use the follow up option. -Revamping SLAs for quote submittal based on job priority."
fmPilot2,"The app could use some improvements, techs have a hard time checking in and out and sometimes work orders take 3-5 minutes to load. Overall the app is very slow. "
fmPilot2,adjust the overall size and layout to be adjustable as you expand it.
fmPilot2,The system is very slow most days. Not very user friendly for us or vendors. 
fmPilot2,The number of crashes and updates that need to happen slows our work. Every time an update happens it causes weeks of issues. It loses data that has been put in LL contacts. You have to refresh it serval times to populate a page. This makes it very difficult for my team and myself to service our client. 
fmPilot2,"It needs to be more user friendly for users with more than one location. Maybe an option for the calendar to have location added so we can view only WO's for that location, or have the WO numbers showing on the dates without having to click on them to open them. All vendors need to update WO's quicker. "
fmPilot2,Needs a more advanced and integrated search feature/system. This program is convoluted and cumbersome to navigate through. Nothing about the program is anywhere intuitive
fmPilot2,This system needs to be user-friendly and less clicking in order to submit a ticket. 
fmPilot2,YEET
fmPilot2,Allow vendors to remove comments when placed on the wrong work order.  
fmPilot2,"Your app should be simple.  Once you take pictures at the site when work is completed, then invoicing and payment should automatically follow. "
fmPilot2,webpage loads terribly.  doesn't respond well.  slow and experiences many glitches.  
fmPilot2,"Work order location defaults to the wrong location than mine every work order.  Too many clicks and menues to create a work order.  do not get updates to my email when wos are approved, finished cancelled put on hold etc.  dont know who gets my WO,  very difficult to search for work orders I have created, no easy way to follow up on work orders unless you write down work orders and check on them manually..  Techs do not have the same work order numbers as I create when they do their work.  "
fmPilot2,The page tends to get stuck when trying to hit the save button. 
fmPilot2,es una excelente herramienta de trabajo.   Nunca la cambien.
fmPilot2,"Yes, there can be a restructure on a lot of the unnecessary drop-down menus that would be great. Also adding a entry so when we add our invoice, we don't have to input the invoice twice and it can be copied over to your system."
fmPilot2,"It make my job more easier to know were to go, when we are confronting problems with anything that needs fixing that needs repair right away for our unit. "
fmPilot2,There was inadequate training.  There is little support available for questions.  The vendors chosen for HVAC issues have been awful.
fmPilot2,1. An option to research payments vendors receive. 2. An option to inquire within the fmPilot portal about a particular invoice.
fmPilot2,New UI is a big laggy at times.  Like after you create a work order you're having to refresh it for it to load the completed work order on the screen.  Sometimes the new UI won't load for me in Chrome.
fmPilot2,Speed and improve ease of use. 
fmPilot2,Please make more user friendly!
fmPilot2,Clearer communication on status of open work orders. 
fmPilot2,It's really difficult/impossible to research past tickets. We'd like to be able to do that.
fmPilot2,"I have to lo in and out several times before it puts my name and email address in boxes. I can enter them manually, but page won't advance to next page. FRUSTRATING!!!!!!!!!"
fmPilot2,It is a good site.
fmPilot2,"All my log in to not time out. It's inconvenient having to log out and back in, sometimes, it takes doing it twice, to allow me access to the service desk. I like the portal more than some others we use but the timed-out issue can be frustrating when in a rush.  "
fmPilot2,"Put a limiter on how many times a day it's going to ask the same user for feedback on the program. I'm sure this survey is going to produce highly accurate statistics to base changes on with all the duplicative results, but perhaps allowing one submission per person would be an alternative approach."
fmPilot2,times out too quickly  
fmPilot2,"We would prefer you trash fmPilot and go back to emailing out jobs and PO's, and enter invoices and quotes yourselves instead of making the vendor do all the work."
fmPilot2,more status to change to. waiting on vendor proposal. waiting on final docs. 
fmPilot2,Keep us better informed on the status of our service requests via email/call. 
fmPilot2,no
fmPilot2,Having the abilty to adjust techs times would be helpful. 
fmPilot2,Using better vendors that can make the repairs better. Some of the vendors that show up are very sketchy.
fmPilot2,There are too many buttons to push just to submit a quote or invoice. It is also frustrating that you can't just type in the price. Almost all of our quotes or invoices are rejected. It takes way too long to submit. It isn't worth the time it takes trying to get paid for a job we promptly completed. 
fmPilot2,no comments 
fmPilot2,Check list or repairs should be mandator to down load so every one can see what work was completed.
fmPilot2,Obligatory contact details for the orders.
fmPilot2,"the website doesnt work to set up and schedule non emergency workorders, i can never get to a place to submit.  i just call for all workorders."
fmPilot2,fixit 3.0 worked just fine now I can't log onto FMPILOT
fmPilot2,Bulk invoicing 
fmPilot2,There needs to be and Other tab when creating a WO as sometimes there are special request that need done.
fmPilot2,It would be nice if we could get better/easier communication in the portal.
fmPilot2,An interface update would definitely be an improvement. As well as an easier way of tracking WO history.
fmPilot2,"FMpilot is very good website and very useful for submitting invoices and quotes for different types of work orders, the only thing i would suggest in updating is deleting different files on work orders "
fmPilot2,THE SITE DOESN'T ALWAYS HAVE EASY ACCESS  AND WON'T ALLOW ME TO CREAT A WORK ORDER (HAPPENS QUITE OFTEN I MIGHT ADD) THEN I END UP CALLING IN TO CREATE A WORK ORDER OVER THE PHONE.
fmPilot2,the status updates online could provide more info related to the work that was completed as well as be better matched to the actual situation on the ground.  Sometimes status updates too late or too early to reflect what has actually been done.  
fmPilot2,"logs off very frequent, noone updates the wo on time."
fmPilot2,"More training. i have been LOST for months with this system, I am finally getting somewhere after I had training."
fmPilot2,"Allow for bulk invoicing of multiple PM work orders on 1 invoice, applicable to same site work orders."
fmPilot2, sometimes hard to find the correct category to select for certain workorders. 
fmPilot2,Make it more user friendly.
fmPilot2,searching for stores workorders when you don't have the WO#. It should pull all orders whether open or closed.
fmPilot2,fmPilot is extremely outdated and is slow to load and user experience is not user friendly. 
fmPilot2,No ideas
fmPilot2,N/a
fmPilot2,"""Associated Users"" when attempting to add a comment; this doesn't always have who all needs to be included.  The ability to recall a quote within 10-30 minutes of submitting would be great, as would the ability to delete duplicate and/or unnecessary attachments that were accidentally submitted. "
fmPilot2,simplify drop down options and make it easy to add pictures of issues.
fmPilot2,"Scrap it and start over.  Model Service Channel.  FMPilot is clumsy, especially with building a quote.  Also, service provider should be able to submit a quote/RFP without needing to wait for a work order from the client.   This is one of the worst client websites available."
fmPilot2,Easy app after you use it daily.
fmPilot2,To improve the speed and simplified it process.
fmPilot2,very good
fmPilot2,"For quotes, the description box once you enter a big paraph, it hard to navigate into the whole paraph."
fmPilot2,"GRAY SCREEN CONSTANTLY, I WASTE SO MUCH TIME JUMPING FROM ONE BROWSER TO ANOTHER. REFRESHING MY SCREEN SEVERAL TIME BEFORE I SEE A ANY WORK TICKETS. ONCE I CREATE A WORK TICKET IT WILL NOT SAVE. EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING."
fmPilot2,it is difficult to use and confusing
fmPilot2,"Make it easier to search jobs, enter correct completion date and time, space out PM's, and the app isn't very user friendly. "
fmPilot2,"We love it, it makes our job from check in to invoicing very easy."
fmPilot2,Work with the same urgency in trying to get us to take a call as doing the invoicing / approval. When trying to get help we have gone weeks without answers. 
fmPilot2,Expecting processing speed 
fmPilot2,The length of time spent searching for invoices and many times the assigned location is no the default at sign in
fmPilot2,Find a way to keep it running instead of going down every other week 
fmPilot2,My clinic does not have a maintenance person to trouble shoot or prevent $$$ losses. Would like to have a person that can maintain the property. I am now noticing the refrigerator making an unfamiliar noise but nobody to check and do preventive maintenance.  
fmPilot2,Better response to issues. 
fmPilot2,Techs have trouble logging in on their phones a lot of the times.  Won't recognize location or will just buffer for long periods of time.   Also sometimes when submitting invoices line items will randomly drop off causing us to reject and resubmit. 
fmPilot2,"When sending out the email of work orders, include a link to FMPilot website. Also, require a direct phone number for onsite contact. It has been difficult to complete work at large facilities when there is not a direct contact with knowledge of issue we are out to service. "
fmPilot2,Would be great if quotes could transfer over to invoicing. 
fmPilot2,More timely completion of work orders. 
fmPilot2,Too much in and out of orders to get something invoiced and processed. 
fmPilot2,"It would be helpful if it were easier to submit quotes, invoices, and if the IVR worked more. "
fmPilot2,There was a small period of time that the PM was already in the money area and that was nice because I didn't have to enter the same amount over and over.  We get the same amount for every PM so if it is automatic - that would sure be nice.  
fmPilot2,It's very hard to create a proposal and searching for work orders. 
fmPilot2,Allow more time for your prompts during a check in / check out phone call. Our vendors almost never check into FMP2 because of the difficulty they experience trying to check in and check out of your IVR system.  
fmPilot2,Wish there was an option to be able to delete a specific uploaded document/photo etc easily.
fmPilot2,Don't know first time
fmPilot2,"resolve things quicker, be able to view completed work orders."
fmPilot2,Not user friendly 
fmPilot2,My only complaint is not being able to delete an attachment if needed or uploaded in error.
fmPilot2,"When you create child WO's many times it is not working, you should try 3-4 times, or close and reopen it. This is so frustrating..."
fmPilot2,Less questions
fmPilot2,Fix the IVR so it is easier for techs to log in and out instead of telling you that you have made to many errors.  I have called the IVR to check a tech out lately because he was unable to do so and it kept telling me I made to many errors and hangs up.
fmPilot2,:)
fmPilot2,More user friendly. Easier to navigate. Some dummy proof directions.
fmPilot2,FmPilot is pretty much a breeze.
fmPilot2,The system is not a good fit for my customer because the types of calls we are sent have extended completion dates due to new manufactures and other circumstances that make the grading system inaccurate. Also the IVR has issues so often that the grading system for that is also inaccurate.  
fmPilot2,"Easy access to gain info and progress to third party vendors, such as Back flow inspections, major HVAC projects"
fmPilot2,Make it operate correctly. takes some times 5 times to open a work order correctly vary slow and sluggish. makes job harder and takes longer.
fmPilot2,the job waranty
fmPilot2,The system is too difficult to navigate and submit invoices.  Too many steps involved for a simple process.  The excel exports take forever to pull even for a simple report.  Need an option to delete PDF's since errors do occasionally happen and there is not currently an end user option to delete.
fmPilot2,I have worked for many brands and bar none the Team for FM Pilot is by FAR THE BEST! I am amazed at the very short response time and the professionalism of the teams that respond! Hat's off to your entire team!
fmPilot2,Certain functions like pulling up tracking or interactions on a work orders would be nice if it didnt take 2-3 mins to pull up
fmPilot2,"Communication, updates, follow up, e-mails etc...."
fmPilot2,easier display of screen vital info 
fmPilot2,"WEB-579402 had issue with invoicing. Could not add the dollar amount under the ""Labor"" tab. Spent almost one hour with a Senior Rep only to find out that there is a bug.  Was resolved by adding ""Labor"" charges under ""Trip Charge"". "
fmPilot2,"The application used in our day to day operation is very crucial when operating b2b transactions at high volumes.  Thus requires the complexity of the application to handle large numbers of transactions in a single day.    This application does not allow us to run at full potential and lacks the simplicity needed to be truly useful.  Constant Lags, Status options that do not communicate to the end user effectively, and the lack of communication after repeatedly reporting of issues found in application are just a few reasons we would not recommend this product."
fmPilot2,Simply process. Allow vendors to reach out to you. 
fmPilot2,EVERTHING IS FINE THANKS
fmPilot2,"communication with the location is very crucial, especially with response times. "
fmPilot2,It's not property service with my job. This app has a Lotta issues to complete.
fmPilot2,make it easier to find vendors
fmPilot2,Unsure
fmPilot2,This is the only way to invoice so I have not comments
fmPilot2,IVR system doesn't always work.
fmPilot2,maybe make app usage easier 
fmPilot2,Communication needs improvement 
fmPilot2,"Correct the grey screen issue and having to refresh to get FMP to work correctly.  It has gotten much better, but still will not load sometimes with out me having to right click and refresh my browser."
fmPilot2,Make it easier to locate work orders and share visibility between work teams
fmPilot2,When doing responses or even emails off FM there is times it would be nice to have a split screen of looking at invoice and comments at same time.
fmPilot2,Access to more quotes revisions - being able to edit more quotess
fmPilot2,"Going back to individual work orders for the week, it is too complex for our technicians to understand that there is only 1 work order for four separate weeks of services. The App never works and there is no way to search by site name on the app. Work orders disappear from our app and the website end as well. You cannot change the filter settings on the website as well after you have already saved one version."
fmPilot2,More servers for quicker access
fmPilot2,Improvement in the comments section on how the messages appear would be good.  
fmPilot2,Been trying to get a facility added to me for over 4 months. Have been approved on my end but is still not on my company profile. Need IT help that users can call instead of constantly having to call CBRE for them to send e-mail to IT but  IT never calls back to help.
fmPilot2,"When trying to contact someone via email through the portal it is takes forever to get a response, if at all. There needs to be better contact information for getting a hold of a responsible party for questions. "
fmPilot2,better vendors  / less expensive and local 
fmPilot2,Making updates come with notifications to whichever manager puts in the request.
fmPilot2,So many ways but I'm not a website engineer.
fmPilot2,tutorials on functions!!!
fmPilot2,"Communication is poor between our station, Fedex facilities maint. CBRE and the contractors. Everyone should be updating the work orders so everyone knows what is going on and updating all and any updated timelines for completion."
fmPilot2,Align the search menu in a more user friendly manner at the entry and search store level.
fmPilot2,"There are issues with current work orders not showing when opening the page or when adding all filters. We find that we have to exit out, or go to another page and then go back to the main page for all the work orders to show. We have had a couple instances where work orders have been closed out before the work is complete and apparenlty its due to a system problem or wrong location assignment in the system. It would be nice to be able to run a report of all workorders and their statuses in order to keep track since the system seems to be innaccurate a lot"
fmPilot2,Get rid of it. 
fmPilot2,"actually come in when we ask you to, and when something is set to a HIGH PRIORITY it is treated as such. It is not acceptable to have to a rodent infestation. Thanks. "
fmPilot2,Allow for invoices to be deleted if uploaded in error.
fmPilot2,"Please email the stores with updates on work orders so we are aware of vendors coming in. Many times, we are unware a vendor is arriving and surprises the LOD. Recently, we had a repair for an emergency exit and first vendor created a quote. Corp decided to get another quote for a second vendor, however no communication to the store caused confusion with LOD and sent second vendor away."
fmPilot2,REQUIRE that notes are entered as to what a vendor did to resolve the problem.  Upload quotes that are visible us  -  who knows are buildings better than us ??
fmPilot2,Edit option for logs.
fmPilot2,No improvements
fmPilot2,It takes far too many attempts to get our vendors to due what they are contracted to do.  IE. sprinkler turn ons.  We need more accountability from our vendors to do the scope of work they bid.   
fmPilot2,By far the worst on the internet
fmPilot2,being more user friendly where it does not want to glitch and runs smooth.  
fmPilot2,"All categories would have scored a 10/10 if the stores didn't have to separate ticket requests from IT/maintenance.   For example, LP card reader problem is a selection on the menu but in reality you have to call IT to get a ticket.  Another example is: if you are having trouble with getting music into your store you have to call IT vs submitting a ticket to FM.   To streamline the process of store maintenance  and to spend less time on deciding where and/or who a ticket needs to be submitted to, please combine all ticket request into one facility.  "
fmPilot2,"Pricing is locked in and we do different levels of work that require different pricing. The Estimate to invoice transfer doesn't work most of the time. If you upload an invoice it doesn't recognize it even when we have already added the invoice number where asked, it tells you to upload it again - redundant waste of time. Things sometimes just disappear and then we are forced to do it all over again - wasted time. I am sure there are a few more quirks that I do not remember."
fmPilot2,IVR in real time
fmPilot2,Make it user friendly
fmPilot2,Work orders and responses to work orders have taken longer than normal.
fmPilot2,"It's not very intuitive, seems to lose work orders, Placing a work order is a little frustrating due to all the prompts. "
fmPilot2,Speed up the new UI so it works as well as old UI does.
fmPilot2,Make the page load fully before opening up on the screen so I can actually see what I'm doing.
fmPilot2,add the ability to remove uploaded photos. Why this is not already an available feature is beyond me.
fmPilot2,Website is glitchy. I sometimes have to refresh a 10 times to get it to load. I've even had to log off and log back on to get something to load. Its not very efficient.
fmPilot2,I like it just like it is.
fmPilot2,Cant think of anything right now
fmPilot2,So far so good
fmPilot2,"Tickets can be difficult to find, especially when they have been closed.  "
fmPilot2,If it did not erase everything when the system freezers up. 
fmPilot2,"It would be nice to see my open work orders easier.  I just want to see mine not everyones.  Also it would be very helpful to be able to ask questions regarding WOs.  Such as requesting a timeline follow-up, or add more information once submitted. "
fmPilot2,"Your NTE's are a joke & your invoice processing procedures are ridiculous- ""PENDING CLIENT INV APPROVAL"" ""PENDING VENDOR VERIFICATION"" etc etc..- we are real close to not using you."
fmPilot2,"Sometimes it is not easy to pull up work orders, because the wrong category is selected and you aren't sure, otherwise it's great!"
fmPilot2,Work on the speed of it and less instances of getting error messages or being unable to use the site. 
fmPilot2,Do not allow Out of Scope services to be performed on a Regular Land Service work order.  A PM.
fmPilot2,Need more options that pertain to certain things within the office. Such as issues with the clinic chairs and television problems in the clinic.
fmPilot2,I had to create a work around to place a work order. The support is non existent.
fmPilot2,There is no way to change the password in reset email or inside the app. We have to send for one every time we want to log into fmPilot. 
fmPilot2,too many times i put in  a work order adn after typing it all in it will not go through.  I have to wait a day or two before it will go through.
fmPilot2,"When opening a new work order, it will often not autofill the requestor information making it so I have to reload the application every time to put in a work order."
fmPilot2,Making the symbols for all the different aspects more user friendly - i am not computer savvy so to try and understand some of the symbols and to navigate can be difficult
fmPilot2,We use it because we were told we had to- its an extra step for me that wasn't needed
fmPilot2,looking for better companies that provide us with better service 
fmPilot2,Add all emails to client emails 
fmPilot2,"Very difficult to use, always have problems "
fmPilot2,More non tech savvy user/client friendly interface. Including more common language for drop down menus
fmPilot2,"More communication between facilities and store when ""crew/tech"" is assigned, delayed or canceled."
fmPilot2,Payment processing is a massive inconvenience. All the options to choose from or not user-friendly. There is no updates when something has changed other than through your email please hinder and cost us valuable time.
fmPilot2,Time seems to be an issue
fmPilot2,have to re-login every hour or so
fmPilot2,"The thing I dislike the most about fmPilot is when I am putting together a larger quote. I have to pay attention to the time and click save every 5-10 minutes. I have had on multiple occasions where ive put together very large bids taking me over 30+ minutes and when i go to save it will like time out and ill loose everything from my quote and have to start over completely. The next thing i dislike is when I invoice a job, we have to wait for pending verification. Even though i have the invoice completed and submitted. I feel like if our invoice is already done, we shouldnt have to go back in again after verification status is complete, just to change the status again for our invoices submittal. When im done with a job, i invoice it and when the store verifies. That should be it, I shouldn't have to go change status again to submit our invoice. I forget about this all the time and it causes us more days waiting to be paid for our work. Or if we already have a signed work order, why do we have to wait up to 3 more days for the store to verify the work is done? If a Manager signed our work order, isn't that already verifying the works been complete? My last complaint would be when i get a work order with a DNE on it. I go out and look at the job to inspect and verify what all is needed to complete the scope. I dont get a MOD to sign the work order at that time, as i have the intent of doing the job. However, their have been times where i complete an inspection and get back to my office. I run the numbers for labor and material, realize i need a DNE increase and submit a quote. My quote doesnt get approved and i invoice for incurred. Then the invoice gets kicked back because i dont have a signed work order, this has happened at least 5-6 times. I dont think i should have to get a signature on a work order when we dont complete the scope thats detailed on the work order. I also shouldnt have to drive back out to a property for a signature, just for the cost of 1 trip charge. We have had to do this before as well and its more of a pain and takes more time to deal with it then what our trip charge is worth. I think a different way to invoice for our incurred trip charges should be available and they shouldn't require a signed work order either. "
fmPilot2,maybe extend the time before it times out.
fmPilot2,Not sure if its on FMPilot but we have loading issues. Other than that it would be nice to have access to the SP code and the quote (when there is one) from the finance tab. 
fmPilot2,it is so cumbersome to add items to a quote.  make this a lot simpler.
fmPilot2,Better reports Easier navigation 
fmPilot2,Need better training 
fmPilot2,VENDORS OR CBRE SHOULD ALWAYS BE SURE COMMENTS ARE UPDATED IN PORTAL
fmPilot2,FmPilot is by far the best interface among all we use for different clients
fmPilot2,So far very easy to navigate no issues 
fmPilot2,Nothing is straight forward or simple.  Revamp whole system
fmPilot2,Get rid of having to put WEB in front of the numbers to find a work order. If quote rejected then have the avialabilty to do a new quote without having client having to reset to pending quote
fmPilot2,not very intuitive
fmPilot2,improved choices for coding of work orders
fmPilot2,"The biggest ask I have is for the results of a work order to be put in the comments.  Often work orders will show as complete, but many days will go by without any update regarding what work was done.  "
fmPilot2,It would be better to know when there will be scheduled appointments of vendors to take care of issues.  Most of the time it is a surprise and they don't normally have the information we need to determine why they are there in the first place without ome detective work.  
fmPilot2,Nothing everything worked great
fmPilot2,"I have access issues.  After a particular company onboarded, I am only able to access 1 of the two accounts.  If I get into 1, the other is locked out,  Even though the credentials are different for each account."
fmPilot2,NONE
fmPilot2,"Simplify the work order to invoice and propose. too many steps. We work with SMS assist, and it is easy compared to yours. Has all work orders, tabs for communication, pictures, invoice and proposal on each."
fmPilot2,"It hours glasses me out.  Attaching invoices sometimes is quite painful.  This is the 7th time trying to submit these invoices since the end of August.  Once the invoice is attached, sometimes I have to attached 2 or 3 times before it recognizes that it is there.  I am just very frustrated with this system.  I use a lot of different systems and this is one of the ones that is the most painful."
fmPilot2,more choices to select from. 
fmPilot2,Work order creation should list a designated field into which the point of contact can be entered. Vendors and facility technicians should also receive notices that they must schedule site visits with the assistance of the points of contact for work orders.
fmPilot2,Needs to find local vendors instead of 4-5 states away.
fmPilot2,There doesn't always seem to be the right option to put a work order under. 
fmPilot2,Pages are slow to load.  UI in not intuitive. Unable to easily see updates on Work Orders.  
fmPilot2,sometimes it is hard to choose the best category
fmPilot2,BULK INVOICING 
fmPilot2,e-mailed updates on work orders would be helpful.
fmPilot2,easier to pull reports to excel 
fmPilot2,"bring back weekly work orders, rather than expecting reps to get them opened before we arrive monday morning.  have the app cache the photos so it doesn't take longer for the photos to upload than it does to do the work.  have the DNE automatically fill in when submitting invoices.  "
fmPilot2,"Make it work like it's supposed to.  Shouldn't have to refresh a blank screen 20 times to get results. I can't always create a WO, as it won't let me save it, and then I have to start all over again.  Lots of non-productive time lost dealing with fmPilot issues."
fmPilot2,nothing at the moment
fmPilot2,You can't. All of my problems were solved with better accuracy in a shorter period of time and with more direct control before this project launched.
fmPilot2,Fix the system. Some client domain is too slow to load.
fmPilot2,"There were two links when I tried going to make a workorder. Unfortunately, I kept trying to use the inop one until I figured it out. Why not just remove the other link?


"
fmPilot2,More user-friendly as well as quicker to navigate.
fmPilot2,"sources on how use fmPilot better, such as how to complete queries. "
fmPilot2,It logs you out and does not load correctly most of the time.  You have to refresh multiple times for it to load correctly.
fmPilot2,there seems to be glitching with invoices and then it erases all data entered.  Also if we have attachments already attached it should recognize that instead of making us reattach and delete things
fmPilot2,"Buttons for updating work order, create proposal, things like that."
fmPilot2,The program sucks not user friendly.  The company also never pays their contractors
fmPilot2,If you gave us dates for EFT and a place where we can expect our EFT billing information.
fmPilot2,Not really sure one of the easiest portals to use.
fmPilot2,Make invoicing easier would be my biggest complaint. I take a lot of time to provide very detailed quotes for our customers. When i have larger service repairs and have 20+ materials and labor costs on my quote. I think whatever is on my approved quote should auto populate on our invoice. Their could be a simple check box asking if we ended up using that particular material we quoted and or labor for each line item. If i take 20-30 minutes detailing a quote and including every single material with model numbers and etc. It then takes me 20-30 minutes having to copy my quote word for word in order to submit my invoice. That's an hour of my time just to put a quote together and invoice on any larger work orders. 
fmPilot2,User friendly. 
fmPilot2,Better updates on the status of services.
fmPilot2,"When editing invioce, some optios don't allow to modify prices"
fmPilot2,all good
fmPilot2,"Less error messages, pages wont load and majority of the time we have to refresh a few times to be able to see something other than a blank screen."
fmPilot2,Make it more mobile friendly. 
fmPilot2,use a different platform 
fmPilot2,"it used to default to the station ID, now it has a drop down for multiple station ID's. i have entered work orders for wrong station ID. "
fmPilot2,Let us type in our work order issue instead of making us answer the generic questions that do not always fit into the reason we are putting in said work order
fmPilot2,Make it easy and convenient through the village web to make a workorder. I had no orange work order button as it says in the job aid at the top.
fmPilot2,more access. 
fmPilot2,Allow emergent orders to be done over the app again.
fmPilot2,"allow a quote to be uploaded in rows and columns.
"
fmPilot2,It would be great if the types of work order codes were easier to navigate. 
fmPilot2,All is good.
fmPilot2,Would be nice to print a short Version of work order to send to providers with only work to be performed and location info only.
fmPilot2,find a better way to print and invoice work orders
fmPilot2,Make the questions clearer. Seems like =multiple questions asking for the same answers
fmPilot2,opening work orders you continually have to refresh to get it to appear.
fmPilot2,it is difficult to determine what section a WO needs to be placed in at times.  
fmPilot2,Improve the service. It takes forever to get the items done after the ticket has been entered.
fmPilot2,Make it easier to select the area the problem is in. 
fmPilot2,takes a lot of time to place where problem is coming from when it would be easy enough for us to type in a detailed description to where the issue is. 
fmPilot2,"When creating a work order, fields should exist to designated a point of contact for the work order. Work orders should also be transmitted to vendors such that the vendors receive special notices to contact the point of contact before they arrange for any site visits."
fmPilot2,make invoicing easier
fmPilot2,It works great!
fmPilot2,i'm good
fmPilot2,This is a cumbersome tool and I wish vendors would stop using this portal and just use Service Channel. Often when I try to update work orders they don't take . 
fmPilot2,Not making us use it.
fmPilot2,GOOD
fmPilot2,no feedback at this time
fmPilot2,Make the template easier to use and Have multiple location options.
fmPilot2,lot of tech issues
fmPilot2,It would be nice to be able to search by asset (ie searching for freezer work orders)
fmPilot2,the loading speed of pages and actions should be improved.
fmPilot2,fmPilot is a functional data base but navigation on the site could be better. A few things that are kind of a pain are invoicing and the fact that if you make a mistake the invoice number get's hosed up and you either have to add something to the end of the invoice# or give it a new one. 
fmPilot2,"The connection is pretty slow from time to time, even with Google Chrome as browser"
fmPilot2,Always have to close and Reopen to be able to choose a facility.
fmPilot2,"Sign in and out needs to be worked on, there always seems to be an issue with the IVR"
fmPilot2,"allow bid and invoice inputs in more of a rows and columns format.
the current method is hard to review and appears to take more time that other methods."
fmPilot2,"We need a real time, live dashboard that tracks and summarizes tickets by status... this way we can quickly see how many tickets are at what stage, how much money we have spent, or can anticipate spending, what tickets are overdue, have not been touched in a specific period of time, etc..."
fmPilot2,Less clicks to get to the main page
fmPilot2,improved reporting capabilities
fmPilot2,pilot is ok maybe add more options for soap dispensers replacement etc
fmPilot2,so slow. always lagging!
fmPilot2,"Navigating to different screens needs to be better, such as if click the back arrow it completely restarts instead of going one screen back. Also having to be precise including the web or pm number in the search bar, should be able to search partial web or pm numbers "
fmPilot2,Provide the vendor to be assigned along with their contact # so we can follow up if weve not heard from them.
fmPilot2,it works great
fmPilot2,needs to be more intuitive. 
fmPilot2,I need to get my own account. We use one account per branch. 
fmPilot2,"The website is glitchy. I have to close the window and reopen the window for it to pull up our station. As far as the maintenance that we receive, I can put in an emergency work order and it will take weeks to months to get it completed. Most work orders take a long time to get to be completed."
fmPilot2,Timely follow ups on WOs
fmPilot2,"Make it easier for Vendors to run reports.
"
fmPilot2,"Super user friendly. Only issue I've had is getting a new password and not knowing if letters were upper or lower case on ""i"". Had to request a new password "
fmPilot2,It really isn't designed for what I needed to request (shelving and moving electrical outlets) but it was required to use.
fmPilot2,Possibly allow the user to type in specifics when the selectable categories do not fit what the location or actual issue/problem is.
fmPilot2,Modernize UI.
fmPilot2,The sensitivity of using the IVR can be complicating when clocking in & out. It doesn't allow much time to enter information and I receive a lot of error messages causing to change the status manually
fmPilot2,make easier for technicians to check in and out
fmPilot2,The program has glitches and freezes. Often times having to close and reopen multiple times to create 1 ticket. Response time to tickets is long time. Tokay waiting over 1 year to have ceiling tiles replaced. This was recognized on a CAT audit in April 2022 and just replaced recently. 
fmPilot2,Allow upload of attachments during initial submission of work order request.
fmPilot2,"Our work orders are being closed and it has not been completed. I have 4 work orders that this happen to. recent 2 are these= WEB-476621; WEB-459296; Some of them i have put in request multiple times already. If parts need to be ordered or get a quote from a vendor the tickets should not be closed. I escalated to  your manager and my ticket was never reopened again after stating it would be taken care of. Are you all aware that we as FAs are documenting status of all physical plant in our FHR meeting every month and state surveyors are reading our IPs in physical plant and giving clinics deficiencies?

also sometimes when the submit button do not appear consistently when you are ready to 
submit at the bottom.  I have to minimize % very little to see that green button"
fmPilot2,"Have to open page multiple times, when I go in to put in a work order it wont bring up my name or facility unless I close and reopen page 3-6 times and this can be frustrating and time consuming."
fmPilot2,IT IS SOMEWHAT CONFUSING USING THIS PROGRAM SIMPLYFLYING THE TABS AND MAKING IT MORE USER FRIEDNLY 
fmPilot2,Get rid of FMPilot and use VendorCafe or ServiceChannel.  FMPilot is antiquated and not user-friendly.  
fmPilot2,it would be nice to be able to place urgency of service on escalating scale  
fmPilot2,Offer possibility of opening an 'urgent' ticket directly online without speaking with an agent. Thank you!
fmPilot2,YEEEET
fmPilot2,Faster turn around time from when repairs are put in to their completion
fmPilot2,Fix the system. Some specific client domains are not working/too slow to load.
fmPilot2,It's sometimes difficult to get a response to questions.
fmPilot2,"No way for Providers to manage work orders apart from account teams seeing updates, forcing providers to use or invent an alt way to manage work orders.   Many glitches, when submitting quotes,   IVR info not clearing identifiable or editable.  Slow,   To long to pull reports, and reports often are not robust enough.   "
fmPilot2,"* Alphabetize all drop down menus.  * Set up Senior Managers to approve quotes. The app allows it, just not the WEB version. * The app does not save filters * Need to require vendors to upload all service records to work orders * Need to make mandatory the requester for a work order to include their name AND telephone number before can save a work order  * "
fmPilot2,Constant lagging can be frustrating. 
fmPilot2,"It would be easier to log in once and not have to log in and out a million times a day, also quoting is a pain since you have to paraphrase your work recommended."
fmPilot2,Less laggy
fmPilot2,No ideas for improvement.
fmPilot2,"On seasonal work orders.  Once the status moves to ""Closed"", There's no way to tell the Tech if a work order has made it's way through the billing process.  For example:  A PMEX or OOS work order will go to PVINV status.  We can see the the various stages all the way to ""Completed"""
fmPilot2,"Less down time with the app More info of the site on the work ticket (gate codes, managers, hazards...) Having the work tickets generated for the month instead of by the week. There is not enough time, if tickets don't generate or if there are issues like a wrong DNE, on a Monday morning to have tickets generated before techs are on site working. That adds hours of un paid office work to download all the pictures once the tickets are finally generated. Plus it allows us to plan our weeks out better     "
fmPilot2,The overall user experience is lacking. Searching for work orders is complicated. The work order dashboards are hard to navigate through to find the right information. Comments seem to go unnoticed at times.
fmPilot2,"Whenever I first log in it fails to register my location, need to refresh it once or twice and then it registers my location properly."
fmPilot2,everything went well but when sent order I do not like diferent contractor it kind mess up because the first one contractor with plumber few week later i had to sent call back they send different contractor plumber over and kind waste money to do. 
fmPilot2,The biggest main thing is repairing the continuous lagging/loading issues. It has been so long (years) since the system has actually loaded correctly. Everything else is minor compared to that problem. 
fmPilot2,Make the system load and work faster. Often the issues I am having are on the list in a department that doesn't make sense. Creating a search tool that went by typing out the issue that is on there would be helpful! 
fmPilot2,Improve website interface. Less color/filter options. Simplify it. 
fmPilot2,Can make accessibility and options of status' more available
fmPilot2,improve communication 
fmPilot2,STATUS
fmPilot2,no suggestions.  It is very user friendly.
fmPilot2,Stability needs vast improvements. The Website is barely functional and sometimes even logs into the backend client instead of the user interface. I am Often unable to create a ticket without reloading/relogging multiple times. I would not use this software if I had the choice due to rampant issues and bugs.
fmPilot2,Software is clunky and often needs to be restarted before the work order function works properly.
fmPilot2,Can't think of a thing
fmPilot2,"Under actions, when submitting an invoice, the option to submit an invoice is much too close to the option to zero and invoice...either some more space between them or if when you choose ""zero an invoice"", there were a pop-up that allowed you to confirm the action rather than just automatically closing it. There also seem to be some glitchy things that if you don't do everything in just the right order, you possibly lose all your work and have to start over...very frustrating."
fmPilot2,Make it easier to connect with colleagues within the portal
fmPilot2,"Better response time, more intuitive, allow to go to any WO status from any WO status"
fmPilot2,"Either remove or improve the IVR check in process. All my techs have issues with it. Notify the person who created the work order when a comment is made so they can give an answer. I never receive replies to my comments. Come up with more a chat based program for customers and suppliers. Needs to be far more user friendly. Come up the an ""action required"" option on the work order tab. SO when answers are needed someone specific is notified. "
fmPilot2,"I hate that if you don't use the system within minutes, you have to resign in."
fmPilot2,Answer the messages we put in the portal :)   Tell us quicker if our tech is NOT going to get an increase so we can send him to his next job and not waste his time waiting.   Give us DIRECT contact numbers to call!!!! It is frustrating to call and not get a designated person. 
fmPilot2,"1 - easier search capabilities (more user-friendly), 2 -  eliminate (or at least edit) some of the questions that pop up on the dialog boxes that are poorly written, and really have no impact "
fmPilot2,"I'm honestly not sure.  Maybe tear it down and start over?  It's so complicated you have to train people how to use it.  It's finicky and buggy.  Your own customer service reps struggle with it.  If you do ONLY ONE THING, please fix the attachment issue.  Please please please. "
fmPilot2,Response time on tickets is very long. It takes much longer for service since we have switched to CBRE.
fmPilot2,"Fix it, then allow for access  and use by phone."
fmPilot2,System/WO status update processing speed could be a little faster as to not cause confusion.
fmPilot2,Puede mejorar 
fmPilot2,You need to improve FsElite Connect BIG TIME...because we have problems clocking in and getting into the app...IT IS SUCH A BIG HEADACHE!
fmPilot2,"When you start to make a ticket for a site it should be a lot easier to know if there are pending ticket / Quotes anything for a site, not just once you start opening up the equipment and type of issue."
fmPilot2,Unable to provide as at the current moment there are no complaints
fmPilot2,scrap it
fmPilot2,There needs to be
fmPilot2,"it used to default to my location. if im not paying attention, i have added work orders for other locations in error. "
fmPilot2,Validate vendors better. Reaction time to emergency work orders
fmPilot2,Simplify  Easier communication Better support
fmPilot2,Search by store number
fmPilot2,Improve ease of quote submittal.
fmPilot2,Alerts when work orders are ready for payment. I only need to see my work orders not every station. Sometimes entries are problematic. 
fmPilot2,Pay our vendors quicker. Answer calls and return calls quicker.Find vendors that are not so expensive to use.
fmPilot2,Tickets sometimes don't populate for viewing after they've been placed so it's hard to respond to things or keep track of what's going on
fmPilot2,training on how to use and what is required by PM/PS using the porgram
fmPilot2,Accuracy in work orders would be best. So long as the work orders are accurate with what the service providers know or are experiencing then it would be a huge improvement.
fmPilot2,lot's of lag
fmPilot2,This system needs improvement. It is such a pain to use that I'm debating whether or not to even continue doing work for IFM. Doesn't seem worth it.
fmPilot2,My address does not populate. I have to make 10+ attempts to change/update the correct address.
fmPilot2,Fix client website issues. 
fmPilot2,"There needs to be an easier way to run reports in FMP. The way to set up filters, etc. is not intuitive, is cumbersome to users, very complicated and frustrating.  Also, the only convenient way to search for a work order is with a PO/WEB number. If I'm doing a search and do not have that criterion, I'm dead in the water.  "
fmPilot2,Password reset ability from a store level where password can be determined by store
fmPilot2,"less clicks and menues to create a work order,  not default to location that I am not at, send push emails on status and when work orders are complete.  Too time consuming to schedule a work order and follow up on the status of it."
fmPilot2,streamline updates by removing the need to choose what company to update and just making them use a universal system/code so you can get in and out
fmPilot2,more self service tools
fmPilot2,"I FIND THAT THE PROCESS CAN BE DIFFICULT AT TIMES, NOT VERY USER FRIENDLY."
fmPilot2,Thank you
fmPilot2,Need new platform!
fmPilot2,not sure what it is
fmPilot2,Its as easy as it gets
fmPilot2,"I have put in many Work orders in, and found that the Vendors coming out to service will only do what is on work order rather than calling in and getting approval; if something was missed in work order and getting approval for completing other items that were missed when making work order. I am Dissatisfied with this service. I have to make a new work order and a new charge to the clinic to have them come out to facility and make appropriate repairs, when they could have added to work order in with approval for similar scope of work. I hope this issue could be addressed due companies are over charging DaVita for good customer service."
fmPilot2,allow us to be able to update or cancel workorders online without having to call. 
fmPilot2,IF we could make it so that we can have multiple tabs running pilot in the same browser that would be helpful- Sometimes I need to have both the client side and the IFM side up at the same time. Also the client side only works in Firefox- It we could make it work across all browsers that would be awesome. 
fmPilot2,Need a way to delete old request.
fmPilot2,"Problem is we do these tickets, but it takes too Long to Get Results from GFS.  The GFS Tech can delete tickets and change ticket to whatever they like."
fmPilot2,Need and other tab when creating work orders
fmPilot2,"I submit invoices to their respective PO's in fmPilot. However, some of the POs hide from me under different status's. Way too in depth - I want to open fmPilot and see all my work orders there - maybe a status to show accepted/paid by Savers Value Village, but otherwise I do not want to have to search for these WO's."
fmPilot2,not always able to view work orders - screen will continuously attempt to load and will not advance.
fmPilot2,"The check-in process is the biggest issue. The automated message cuts you off, you have to try several times to enter a check-in or out. VERY time-consuming. "
fmPilot2,I find myself having to reload the page numerous times in order for it load properly. 
fmPilot2,Make a much more user friendly UI. Having sections and bulkier buttons instead of text to click on would be so much more appealing.
fmPilot2,keep the app working better and it is much easier than desktop version
fmPilot2,Needs to be a better way to directly contact someone regarding outstanding work tickets 
fmPilot2,The navigation of the portal is less than adequate. Searching for open work orders is not easy. You should add e-mail verification once a work order is submitted. 
fmPilot2,scrap it and start over
fmPilot2,The IVR has too many issues.
fmPilot2,Fix the automatic log out which happens every 15 minutes
fmPilot2,"I am told to stop and complete a different form for changing door lock codes, but I cannot locate that selection. Please provide a link. "
fmPilot2,Easier to research prior web orders
fmPilot2,"Update the program, send email notifications when a work order status is updated. "
fmPilot2,update/upgrade this old portal bro
fmPilot2,The quote screen gets a little clunky sometimes when adding in line new line items and filling out each field. 
fmPilot2,This is not user friendly 
fmPilot2,CBRE FOLLOW UP NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED 
fmPilot2,Give updates on tickets or comments made involving work orders in progress or not completed
fmPilot2,"I haven't worked at store 0982 in close to ten years, yet my profile hasn't changed and can't be changed to my current store (0970).  If I try to create a work order, it gets sent to store 0982 "
fmPilot2,Needs to be a bit more training. It's not very efficient to search for work orders when you have to restart search criteria every time you leave current list. It is also hard to give accurate start and completion times if the work order already comes in past due. Need to be able to edit completion times so vendors can receive more accurate score grades. 
fmPilot2,"If using fmPilot worked on all web-browsers and not specific ones for specific parts of the service.  Client side for one browser, IFM for another, a 3rd browser for when one isn't responding well.  It just doesn't work as uniformly as it should."
fmPilot2,More client customization
fmPilot2,The aapp app keep crashing. 
fmPilot2,Very glitchy and difficult to use
fmPilot2,"Improved access availability, escalation of approvals, reduce number of clicks required to view backup information, improve wo status review and improve dashboarding.  Improve vendor onboarding and payment reconciliation. "
fmPilot2,Putting PM's on a better schedule and have the due date prior to the expiration date of inspections.   Better follow-up notifications  
fmPilot2,Stop making it so you have to do so many steps to submit an invoice.  Why do we have to submit an invoice and type it in. Seems redundant. Shouldn't have to have training to learn how to use this system.
fmPilot2,Get rid of it 
fmPilot2,Just fine
fmPilot2,more options for problems or free type space
fmPilot2,The site a bit slow to load from section to section. Otherwise it is a great tool to be able to put non emergency problems into.
fmPilot2,"fmPilot is extremely slow to navigate through, things expire before anything can be accessed or loaded, this is a frequent matter. "
fmPilot2,nothing so far so good. 
fmPilot2,"When I update our schedule date and time in fmPilot, we still get emails asking us for a schedule date. What's the point of putting it in if we are going to be asked about it again in an email? "
fmPilot2,It is not user friendly and very hard to navigate even after using it for a year and a half. It adds a lot of extra work to my day.
fmPilot2,quicker responses  sometimes response can take a few days sometimes they are responded to right away.  more consistency on response time
fmPilot2,"New UI is very slow, especially for SBH"
fmPilot2,"easier invoice submission.  your current set up takes on average 3-4 mins from start to finish to submit an invoice with more than 5 lines.  Most of your invoices submitters have multiple accounts this is not good for efficiency. the ""upload"" system you offer is even clunkier and not user friendly let alone that you are only able to Submit at 10 and 4 and IF  there is enough room the system will pick up your batch submission.  "
fmPilot2,IFM is the absolute worst IVR'n system Ive seen thus far. 
fmPilot2,ETA times updated daily 
fmPilot2,Make it easier to locate just your station. The widgets are not done well and if I dont know the WEB number it takes a while. I should not have to filter through other stations items. 
fmPilot2,"The only issue I have with the site is that I usually need to refresh once or twice before it actually allows me to put in a work order. The first time I load the page and try to add one it usually doesn't allow me to put in my own information on the first page of the form, then once I refresh it will get that information but about a third of the time when I move to the second page it won't let me move through the tick boxes on it."
fmPilot2,Respond quicker
fmPilot2,always crashes during and throughout the days
fmPilot2,"Speed,reduce the error timeouts"
fmPilot2,It would be nice to add comments to work orders without having to know someone's email address. 
fmPilot2,when we input notes no one from CBRE response 
fmPilot2,Be more simplistic in some questions as well as be faster in completing work orders. 
fmPilot2,"Fix the system. Too slow especially, for some client websites."
fmPilot2,"Provide better training for CBRE/FM-Pilot users so that when an invoice or documentation is submitted, they understand what they are looking at so that less invoices are rejected for no reason thereby creating double work for vendor users."
fmPilot2,Quicker response and more follow up. Vendors that can get parts and complete repairs in a shorter time with more reasonable rates.
fmPilot2,"The interface is clunky. Feels like 1990s internet tech. It should be more mobile-friendly, too. Also, there should be an option to delete uploaded photos or files, in case the wrong file is uploaded. "
fmPilot2,be more mindful and diligent with work orders
fmPilot2,be able to upload an image when creating a ticket would be beneficial. 
fmPilot2,Make it MUCH easier to use!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
fmPilot2,It would be nice / helpful  if I could get a response to my messages at the comment section.  When CBRE rep enters a comment / message I respond immediately but when I enter a comment its crickets. 
fmPilot2,Sometimes you can not find the correct drop-down category for the work order that you need to create.
fmPilot2,Make it more intuitive to use
fmPilot2,IT IS TOO EASY TO MAKE MISTAKES WITH HOW FINICKY THIS PORTAL IS. 
fmPilot2,"Allow for attachments (pictures, diagrams, etc.) when either submitting a new WO or responding to the request additional detail."
fmPilot2,"It doesn't always work smoothly, I have to log out of it several times to get the correct info. to populate for me and sometimes the work orders get sent for the wrong facility if you work at multiple facilities.  "
fmPilot2,Everything works great.
fmPilot2,add an icon that shows attachments have been submitted. I have no idea if the images I uploaded have been attached and can be viewed by analyst
fmPilot2,make it easier to find where to invoice ...under finance tab is not as easy to remember when not using portal that often 
fmPilot2,The platform is not user friendly at all
fmPilot2,The search would be better if it was more broad and the input did not have to be exact.
fmPilot2,When emails are sent have tech with an extension when we have certain things come up like onsite approvals needed and the IVR has been messed up since the phone system was updated and checking in and out has become a chore
fmPilot2,Everything is good
fmPilot2,"Fix this: 1.I selected ""remember me"" but it never does.  2.The password is generated by CBRE and I can't seem to change it, so I always look it up.  3.The app hasn't been letting me login or when I do sometimes I can't open the work order."
fmPilot2,"when the client cancels a service request, update and cancel so we don't still go to the location, and then the customer incurred travel cost. "
fmPilot2,The user interface is not very user friendly and a little outdated.
fmPilot2,scrap it and start over 
fmPilot2,get people here to fix stuff after i take time to do this 
fmPilot2,"Follow up on services more easy, email when status change on a service."
fmPilot2,no improvements needed!
fmPilot2,"Follow up calls, easier way to submit emergency work orders. "
fmPilot2,Fix bugs and loading time.
fmPilot2,Stop using it.
fmPilot2,Please incorporate the vendor contact information that will perform the work order. That will make it easier to follow up with the vendor.
fmPilot2,"Slow, difficult to navigate"
fmPilot2,BE ABKLE TO SORT MY WORKTYPE  INVOICE  PENDING QUOTES WHILR BEING ABNLE TO SEE EVERYTHING  
fmPilot2,Refreshing the screen when it goes grey is annoying 
fmPilot2,"When a quote is approved, have the finance information automatically transfer over to the invoice. It takes a very long time to type in quotes and invoices."
fmPilot2,Its good
fmPilot2,Sometimes long delays and unable to see work orders
fmPilot2,Improve search function for looking up orders. Improve warranty recall method.  Add the missing locations for where work needs to be completed inside store.  Add a drop down for normal compactor pickup service. Add being able to access remotely via officedepot.sharepoint.  
fmPilot2,"Now that I'm used to it, it is somewhat easy to use. It was somewhat hard to learn, and I still learn new tricks and features all the time. I NEED it to do my job. It has been pretty solid lately, not crashing or locking up. For a while there, I was copying every longer comment, just  in case it decided to give me an error message."
fmPilot2,Biggest issue is there is no room for error. Typo an invoice number...to bad you'll need to type in another. 
fmPilot2,It would be great if email notifications were sent out once work order status changes. Thank you
fmPilot2,"Although not as much as the past, fmPilot becomes quite slow, especially when attaching pictures.    On a brighter note, we used to have issues weekly with fmPilot, but seems to have gotten better.  "
fmPilot2,"Commenting - having to send an email - is too difficult. Especially adding the appropriate people to the email.  Also, it would be great for it to open to WEB orders and have a separate tab for PM."
fmPilot2,Bridge
fmPilot2,"FMP2 runs very slow at times. Also, the administrator changes/updates without notifications which causes ussues "
fmPilot2,Having trouble when inputing quotes. Description doesnt match when printing out.
fmPilot2,make it easier to submit quotes like service channel or maximo 
fmPilot2,we should be able to type our own category stop closing tickets without updating us on why
fmPilot2,"Should receive alerts to the person submitting the ticket including when the ticket is submitted as well as when updates are being made. A timeframe should be provided when a tech is scheduled to come. If the ticket is cancelled, a notification should be sent. Emergencies should be treated as an emergency."
fmPilot2,Don't have it error out every time we try to create a work order. 
fmPilot2,Site defaults to another location in our district. Sometimes the site lags out and I have had to enter work orders multiple times and if we forget to adjust the location after multiple attempts it will default to another location which causes problems for workers and billing. 
fmPilot2,"Fix the lag keeping me from doing my job. From constantly having to refresh because pages dont fully load to having to completely restart my browser at least once a day, I would say that making it consistent would be a good improvement"
fmPilot2,fix the glitches that make me have to exit the site and re-enter 
fmPilot2,Very outdated system. 
fmPilot2,"Constant refresh is needed.  i have to click refresh almost every time i change to a now screen. often times, it takes several times for the screen to load. "
fmPilot2,"Submitting quotes takes literally an hour on occasion because the sytem will not save, or it will take forever to save. Uploading photos to jobs takes 5-10 tries."
fmPilot2,Overall is works well it sometimes runs a little slow. They could improve the FM Pilot App. 
fmPilot2,"the site has some glitches , makes me relog in several times. other times have to open and close for the page to load."
fmPilot2,"I like the description in newer layout like on the sally client. but the color of work orders is better in the older version Pending quote and PVINV should never have the same color. I would recommend using shades of color for work orders in the same category such as open and entirely different colors for each category like open, financial, completed... please place a copy button in the ribbon for work order number like there is when you go in the work order in the sallybeauty client and if there is a linked IFM work order please have that information viewable int the overview panel/i bubble header. also please include the work order number in the info strip for each comment. basically work order numbers everywhere, make it easy to find and know what work order a user is looking at, working in and commenting on, and if there is a linked provider or client work order associated with the current one. Plese note this does not include parent/daughter references. "
fmPilot2,Please make it so it does not log you off after 30 minutes of non use.
fmPilot2,"The login & out system is not very good, we often cannot log out due to some error message on the IVR system and cannot manually input times online."
fmPilot2,make it easier to upload items and not have to resave everything 
fmPilot2,Honestly it is very simple and easy to use. 
fmPilot2,"VERY BUGGY, CAN'T SAVE ANY QUOTES OR INVOICES IF YOU SKIP OVER ONE ITEM, WOULD LIKE TO SEE A FEATURE WHERE AN APPROVED QUOTE CAN BE CONVERTED TO AN INVOICE TO BE MORE EFFICIENT. "
fmPilot2,Get reliable vendors that know how to fix things and don't over charge like the ones you have now!
fmPilot2,Communicate and arrive in a timely manner
fmPilot2,"Less repetitive emails, able to adjust labor rates for different trades, update date without having to ""save"""
fmPilot2,The questions with yes/no answers should be direct and easy to understand. They're not even close
fmPilot2,Allows to keep the work area at flow!
fmPilot2,"Sometimes FM Pilot is very slow, cannot create child WO's, you have to try few times, close and reopen the browser, try with Chrome, try with Edge.  Very frustrating!!"
fmPilot2,Create an area for 'other' if we have situations where there is something we cannot describe or catagorize.
fmPilot2,it is OK
fmPilot2,some of the choices are limited
fmPilot2,"UI, speed, lagging"
fmPilot2,"the system overall is somewhat cumbersome, and I think aspects could be streamlined. There are also many capabilities that could be incorporated to make the features more adaptable and date more robust when trying to report out. There are other CMMS products I find more intuitive and resourceful."
fmPilot2,Update system with newer technologies More windows based friendly would be better.
fmPilot2,make it Service Chanel
fmPilot2,Nothing at this time.
fmPilot2,"It would be helpful if there was some way of letting the store know when a contractor will be out. Routinely, vendors just show up with no notice. At times they arrive just as we are closing. Other times they arrive and have no information. "
fmPilot2,"to not cancel work orders submitted by facility, when the PMs being made are submitted after inspections expire leaving facility out of compliance. "
fmPilot2,"Easier adding attachments, adding work order items, and invoice acceptance. Every work order takes weeks to put in so the system will accept it. "
fmPilot2,"The loading on the platform is horrible. Having to click on something multiple times to have it load, as well, the system logging you out after a certain amount of time, is frustrating having to log back in especially when you're juggling multiple jobs and even when you're active on the site, it still kicks you off. "
fmPilot2,so far all good
fmPilot2,make it easier to get to your location instead of Palo Alto popping up everytime.
fmPilot2,To improve the speed and not restart every times 
fmPilot2,"Improve data reporting by forcing contractor to breakdown cost ex: Labor, Material, equipment, "
fmPilot2,the ui hurts my eyes
fmPilot2,Sometimes it can be difficult to locate which area of the building you're trying to open W/O for with the drop down options. You have to look around a long time sometimes to find certain things b/c they aren't where you'd think they'd be.
fmPilot2,"response, updates or comments on work orders done through email"
fmPilot2,"Your IVR system does not make sense when you listen to it. That needs to be improved to make it easier, or make it so we can check a tech in online instead of calling. "
fmPilot2,Its antiquated and not user friendly.
fmPilot2,The only issue is that is it slow. 
fmPilot2,"If we could make it easier to filter previous work orders, that would be great. Besides that, just updating the UI."
fmPilot2,"I think it would be useful to have a ""vacation mode"", during times service providers take time off. As opposed to rejecting the WOs and having a negative effect on our records. "
fmPilot2,"More interactive, more choices, a space for non of the above area needs to be included."
fmPilot2,"Have comments always generate a notification to the vendor, location, and support team. Sometimes, comments are added by store but if they take steps to email them, they go unseen. "
fmPilot2,that is goes away
fmPilot2,You seem too focused on the writing and the digital aspects of doing business but we are a hands-on industry and what really matters is that the work is being done and being done correctly and in a timely manner. Yall love to nitpick about details neither the vendor nor the end customer worry much about.
fmPilot2,.
fmPilot2,Better Skilled Communication with FM Pilot individuals who can provide an answer and get things accomplished.
fmPilot2,stop having us double work we want to use our own quote or invoices 
fmPilot2,More Communications
fmPilot2,load speed 
fmPilot2,Emergency addressed quicker
fmPilot2,Make it more user friendly
fmPilot2,Sometimes I reacts slowly and lags. 
fmPilot2,I don't any suggestions at this time.
fmPilot2,"make it easier to use
"
fmPilot2,"checking in through the phone is some times difficult .
maybe if it can be done through the portal it can make it easier "
fmPilot2,"It would be super helpful if we were able to delete images (or) documents that we attach to a work order, as sometimes we are working on multiple work orders at a time and every so often we will submit an image or document that belongs to a different work order.   It's quite a process then to reach out to CBRE and get someone on-line to remove for us.  Thank you!"
fmPilot2,automatically email account holder with comments 
fmPilot2,I have no complaints with the app or website.
fmPilot2,How do I get a store telephone replaced
fmPilot2,"Sometimes there's an error, that I need to redo my inputs after refreshing the tool. Other than that it's all great."
fmPilot2,sort feature is cumbersome
fmPilot2,You should allow us to make a map of our building and then assign assets to them so we can easily click and go 
fmPilot2,Weekly service dates should be more clear for invoicing purposes.
fmPilot2,"Too slow.  Incorrect/incomplete information. Hard to find actual status. System should email users updates instead of us having to search for them.
"
fmPilot2,Figure out how to speed up the system
fmPilot2,Do away with it.
fmPilot2,Make it more mobile friendly.
fmPilot2,Get rid of having to put WEB in front of the number to look something up and then if in Finance and need to go back to overall you have to redo search
fmPilot2,Would be great if approved quotes could be rolled over to invoice so we didn't have to reenter all the info.
fmPilot2,The search functions are quite limited for my use.  
fmPilot2,"Allow us to remove items that we might've accidentally attached to a work order.  Sometimes I work with multiple work orders and multiple computer screens at a time, so it's very easy to accidentally attach pictures or something like that to the wrong work order.  It is VERY difficult trying to get through to someone at CBRE for their help in removing something as mentioned.  Thank you!"
fmPilot2,Nothing 
fmPilot2,"The IVR system for IFM could be improved. You should have to enter your pin on the same phone call more than one time. If you check out multiple work orders on the same call, it should be easier to check out. Also, it would be nice to check in and out on IFM directly instead of having to call it in each time. "
fmPilot2,Change the sleep time from an hour...that is BS.
fmPilot2,"I hope you will be able to fix the kind of lag fmPilot brings to work. It is wasting time and sometimes it is very hard to feel okay, because of the super lag."
fmPilot2,It will time out too quickly.
fmPilot2,I find it difficult to navigate the site.  It can sometimes seem confusing to navigate. But overall it can be a helpful tool.  
fmPilot2,Worked great!
fmPilot2,"Updates to stores about what is going on after the ticket has been issued and someone sent out and then waiting for someone else to approve something. Need more follow up on repeat issues for our roof, ceiling tiles, leakage, etc. Ongoing issues for the past two years and still isn't resolved is a big issue."
fmPilot2,this app waste money and time
fmPilot2,"Very cumbersome.  All options: invoicing, quotes, updates, should be on one page for selection.  It's a chore to do work on your site.  This is a large reason why we typically decline a call, is because we know the admin component via FMpilot is going to be onerous."
fmPilot2,Pay past due invoices!
fmPilot2,allow to be logged in for longer periods to avoid having to log back in multiple times
fmPilot2,"Every time i try and submit an invoice, it tells me requires attachment, even though i have already attached the invoice. "
fmPilot2,a
fmPilot2,Stop changing work description after dispatching
fmPilot2,Make the system stronger so it can handle more people in it at once. In the evening when first and second shift are both here at the same time I find when when I have the most slow down. 
fmPilot2,Responses are slow and there is not alert saying you have a response.
fmPilot2,x
fmPilot2,nothing its great
fmPilot2,"I have had issues where an invoice was submitted but payment was not received.  I'd like instructions on who to reach out to specifically, as it took months to get it straightened out with our customer."
fmPilot2,The system is slow
fmPilot2,sally beauty client doesn't work correctly. consistently doesn't load work order or save changes.
fmPilot2,nothing at this time
fmPilot2,I had to go in and out of Service Insight multiple times before the work order would populate correctly.  This happens more often than not when I need to put in a work order.  I think the software is clunky.
fmPilot2,nothing
fmPilot2,Better service.
fmPilot2,Stop sending me these survey's
fmPilot2,"I receive purchase orders and process invoices in over 60 different sites for hundreds of customers and regarding invoice submission, this is my least favorite. I literally do not understand why it is so complicated and segmented to submit invoice in fmPilot. Invoice submission should be simple with an uncomplicated setup and platform. This should include easy access to each field, previous invoices, and should not be separated in small blocks without even a full screen (why is the screen a small square in my screen?) There should be an obvious field for invoice submission, & for the Invoice Number, and amounts. I mean to create an invoice you select ""submit invoice"", so how do you submit the invoice once it has been created? I submit each invoice at least 4 times.... You have to search for each field and good luck getting back the next time. Try separating the dispatch/work from the final invoice submission. Two different departments perform the functions at almost all companies but fmPilot acts as if it is one function, one process, and one department handling it all. Please try again and see other platforms first."
fmPilot2,"Very hard to navigate. Not user friendly. Poor navigation. Overall, the worst online portal for invoicing compared to the other 25 or so we use. "
fmPilot2,More communication on when we can expect a vendor
fmPilot2,IDK
fmPilot2,"Why do you need to submit the work order before you are able to load the pictures? It tells you that you need pictures for certain jobs, yet you can not upload the pictures until after you have submitted the job."
fmPilot2,"We a ticket is created we dont get updates.
if we add notes or comments to a ticket it goes un notice. We always have to call in for an update week(s) after to follow up. System needs to be better at following up with stores who need the work done in a timely manner "
fmPilot2,Not Sure
fmPilot2,Would rather not have to check fmPilot every minute of the day just to be able to do my job.
fmPilot2,Your web page never loads with all the options i have to refresh several times to be able to fill out the work order. 
fmPilot2,"the stabitity of the mobile app needs improvements, techs often have to check in multiple times to a WEB/PM as the app kicks them out in the middle of running a call.
When an Email notification of a new WEB / PM is printed the location information prints on page 2. would be helpful if job site information was located near the top of the notification. 
when hitting the accept button on an email. would be nice if the app would schedule the call for the SLA time. ei if a P4 is accepted an 12 Noon, the scheduled time would auto populate for 4PM. "
fmPilot2,"basic functions!
I cant look up a web order currently. and your goddamnd survey popping up every 3 minutes is pissing me off!"
fmPilot2,"Ease of use.  Locating previous tickets.  Sometimes the issue that needs to be addressed isn't easily located, if at all."
fmPilot2,"I'm not sure how this can be improved. On the Vendor's side it's definitely easier to just talk to our contact directly, and set up the work orders on our own system. Now we have to do both. One in our system and one in the Vendor program. Many companies are switching to vendor programs and they're all different, so we have to learn each one. It's time consuming to say the least."
fmPilot2,"Fix the issues:

Putting a quote in is very frustrating. It times out and you have to start over. 
It is constantly losing information and you have to restart the program.
Not user friendly at all.
There are too many reasons I am dissatisfied with this program.
There is noone to call when there is a problem, very poor tech support.
Slow to correct any problems and most of the time they are not corrected."
fmPilot2,"We should receive emails on all work orders. I typically see work orders for pest control and janitorial, but no one shows up for this. Is someone supposed to show?"
fmPilot2,Nothing at the moment
fmPilot2,not log out after a short period of time
fmPilot2,Get it to stop freezing after every other ticket we search. 
fmPilot2,When first logging on the clinic @ comes up 0 and is not able to change. I have to back all the way out of system and then retry. Finding things is not user friendly. Also system has items that you can select but  CBRE does not do! Like alarm 
fmPilot2,"Ensure that the description box can support enough characters or if there is an error, we do not have to repeat the entire entry of a WO."
fmPilot2,The sorting of a list can be improved
fmPilot2,Make it more user friendly. It's to hard to navigate.
fmPilot2,"When entering a quote, if I hit the tab key one extra line below the line items and try to save it gives me an error code. After the system gives me the error code, the save icon disappears and I have to re enter my entire quote. HUGE waste of time. Please look into this and fix.  "
fmPilot2,"Pay within terms, not 60 to 90 days late."
fmPilot2,should default to phone number and basically everything is the salesfloor too many options to select from
fmPilot2,Work orders do not get resolved quickly. The site doesn't work when trying to view all work orders.
fmPilot2,"There is a delay the invoices being paid to showing ticket closed.
"
fmPilot2,"it took several attempts before all info was loaded in the app.

"
fmPilot2,Add simple highlighted tabs for when. a folder has a notification.
fmPilot2,Broaden the categories i.e. add refrigeration to the Type field.
fmPilot2,My only issue is with calling into the IVR system.
fmPilot2,takes too long for someone to come and the repairs don't last 
fmPilot2,more intuitive.
fmPilot2,needs to be more user friendly and easier to navigate 
fmPilot2,Add a comment entry option to allow customer to explain what they are requesting                                                                                                                   
fmPilot2,It doesn't always load properly.  Often active tickets are missing from the cue.  We do not receive any notifications when a tickets status changes.  
fmPilot2,Make it easier to use
fmPilot2,COMPLETE THE WORK ORDERS
fmPilot2,How about not putting Survey everytime we open the app?
fmPilot2,"Train staff better to know that PM services are a flat rate when we invoice them. We received 3 invoice rejections this morning, when we have been invoicing them the same way for years. This cuts into other work our office staff needs to be focused on and is extremely frustrating. Also, if there is a SOW or checklist for any jobs, please make sure they are attached to the job instead of asking us to provide a checklist we don't have."
fmPilot2,Continue to be able to be more user friendly
fmPilot2,Make it easier on tickets we put in for the same issue within the warranty period
fmPilot2,fm3 (sally beauty) requires constantly clearing history and refreshing browser to work especially when in work orders. please make linked work order information viewable from the client data strip makes finding work orders from tech calls easier. also please add the copy work order number button viewable in the work orders to the data strip. it is too difficult to copy work order numbers in fm3.
fmPilot2,glitches with changing processes and unit values under manual entry.
fmPilot2,Fix the glitches that force me to log out and back in when the pages fail to load.
fmPilot2,We are unable to reopen work orders that have been closed but are incomplete or incorrect. When comments are added to work orders by center staff there is little to no follow up from CBRE on those comments. 
fmPilot2,"It would be nice to be able to export data for quotes submitted. 

Also would be nice for suppliers to be able to run a KPI scorecard."
fmPilot2,there are some areas where there are not the correct options for what is needed
fmPilot2,Make it more user friendly and easier to get someone on the phone or email back quicker
fmPilot2,Notification of updated status of a ticket. Correct status dates. Often time there is a completion date when the job was not completed. It's confusing. Noted for all the servicing company in FmPilot. Stores are often notified by the company directly without proper notification in FmPilot. 
fmPilot2,"When we get a direct deposit of more than one job, please give us the breakdown of which jobs the money went to."
fmPilot2,"Just simple things, like if I upload photos before I change a ticket status to submitting invoice. Then I get an error because I wasn't actually in the invoice tab when I uploaded the photos. I have to re upload one of the same photos that I just sent, in order for the status to change and invoice to submit.

I wish there was an easier option for signed work orders. So many times either I forget or my technicians forget. A lot of properties are an hour plus away, so to drive back out for a signature can be a pain, if the store isn't able to scan or send us a copy.

Lastly, being we have so many steps that we have to follow in order to accept, change statuses, pending verifications. & invoicing. I think the customer should have some responsibilities as well. Mostly, I feel they should have to upload at least 1 photo of whatever the tickets issue or repair request is. A lot of times, If we would have just had a photo. We could have sent the right tech, or materials, or been more prepared to complete the task. We would have a much faster completion rate on the majority of work orders. If we just had some photos to prep us before arriving to the property."
fmPilot2,Create a search bar for the work orders so we can filter out just the ones for our location rather than the entire district. 
fmPilot2,"Too confusing looking for the right repairs.  And mandatory stuff to answer is too annoying when you don't know how to answer it… those things could
be asked upon a phone call to location from someone in dispatch "
fmPilot2,"Make it easier to attach files, should have an area to attach photos other than having to go back into work order to attach them after submitting. "
fmPilot2,"The site constantly grays out, not allowing users to complete tasks, place work orders, approve invoices, etc. Users have to refresh the site, change browsers to load the site, or have to call in requests for services. "
fmPilot2,the manual submission process is extremely time consuming.  If this was my only 3rd party or account that would be ok but its not...  maybe prepopulate the next box?  or less time between processes.  As well the Bulk Upload is NOT user friendly.  had a really hard time getting it to work. from what i understand that system has never been revamped.  If i have a vote please revamp.  I would use it for all 4 clients i have 
fmPilot2,FM Pilot is highly useful and well formatted for occasional use. But for snow removal very difficult to use in the field. Snow is unpredictable and FM Pilot requires the stores to make requests at very short notice and don't always have the ability to go through FM Pilot leaving us with no actual work order prior to work being completed. Requests are made by the store either by text or phone calls. 
fmPilot2,Improve site glitches that prevent work orders from being created right away. Site has to be refreshed before information will populate.
fmPilot2,default to my location as a user.
fmPilot2,"Improve reporting.
Improve charts and functionality.
Improve technical aspects.
Improve flow of information from vendors and clients to platform"
fmPilot2,"always issues, vendors don't show up, it takes forever to get something done, lack of follow up.. "
fmPilot2,"Make it more vendor friendly. It is very ""corporate"""
fmPilot2,Technical issues: ex. The vendor is not on site - we are there. 
fmPilot2,Im good with it
fmPilot2,Get rid of it. Get a new platform.
fmPilot2,"Better global search options: partial WO number, keywords, locations, etc."
fmPilot2,Default to my location only when I log in. Filter/show all work orders for MY LOCATION ONLY vs work orders for all locations. Flag work orders when updates are given.
fmPilot2,"Allowing scrolling through entire work order list instead of limited to 1 page - takes so long to advance to older time periods when searching for something
"
fmPilot2,too difficult to navigate/find open tickets
fmPilot2,errors
fmPilot2,Nothing to add.
fmPilot2,fix the lagging issue.
fmPilot2,seperate fmp2 and new fmp2 the new fmp2 should be 3 plus its slow loading
fmPilot2,System seems slow when location and name fields require information
fmPilot2,"I use it because its mandatory, but not necessary for what I do- used to it now, but not user friendly. I need to get WO numbers from here, but lately they haven't been available on time"
fmPilot2,Vendors do not update portal with comments or attachments
fmPilot2,The work orders get closed and work has not been done and we are not advised why it was closed or if it was submitted to an outside vendor until we call  and sometimes we lose track so it could be weeks before we find out what is going on.  
fmPilot2,"I have submitted this survey, but it keeps popping up. "
fmPilot2,navigating all the dropdowns can be cumbersome
fmPilot2,Make the reporting feature more user friendly.  
fmPilot2,Knowing who is coming and having the same people come to fix issues would be very helpful. Calling befo0re every visit to let the front desk now when and who will arrive would be very helpful.
fmPilot2,"It is not intuitive whatsoever.
The project ""other"" field has a very useful aspect, but it is never pointed out or utilized properly, because there is never any continued training, for FM Pilot overall. 
Seem odd because it is a wonder platform that a business was built on and had great success using.  
The new client platforms are way too difficult to navigate and they do not filter like the original. For example, if there are groups/child work orders, you can see the file numbers, but you cannot click on the WEB # and open it, like you can in the regular platforms... it might look newer and nicer but is by far not.."
fmPilot2,"Work orders are dropped, not monitored and not completed. I can't find several work orders I have entered and that were never completed. Follow up with the contractors assigned the work order needs to be done regularly until it is completed."
fmPilot2,Ability to easily edit a work order after it has been placed and the ability to delete a work order after it has been placed.
fmPilot2,Hard to find/read the workorders 
fmPilot2,Eliminate creating estimates and invoices in the portal. It is time consuming. We provide an estimate and invoice with the exact same information. 
fmPilot2,"We have an issue logging in on site. At best I am guessing 50% successful.  Ease of adding notes and seeing both areas where there are notes, description, updates, this could be better. Many times we receive information from the store and we really don't understand what the work order entails, which is ok and understandable. Once we get to site, get pictures and assess it, then it helps. It is understandable that the store wouldn't have the expertise. Confirming these pictures are received by management and being able to see additional notes easily would help. (maybe it's us). "
fmPilot2,Bulk invoicing is not user friendly at all
fmPilot2,Couple issues I have is that I check my app every morning but we don't get a lot of work orders as often as we should we are lucky if we get 2 a week and the follow up team isn't very helpful once you have questions about quotes of follow ups on workorders however the help desk people are one of the best customer service representatives I've ever had to deal with
fmPilot2,It takes multiple attempts to get my clinic to load when enter a new work order.  
fmPilot2,no commet 
fmPilot2,"Had little difficulty filling in the pop up page to describe the issue.  I missed one line and it erased the others when I finally figured out how to fill it in.  Finally the ""enter"" key popped up.... "
fmPilot2,I have to refresh the page on almost every service request that I open. The screen freezes and I have to refresh sometimes 3 times. And that happens no matter what browser I use. And cookies and history clear every time I close it.
fmPilot2,Putting up the financial information - if that could be made easier / more fluid; that would help.
fmPilot2,I would like to see it run faster. 
fmPilot2,"Fix this: 1.I selected ""remember me"" but it never does.  2.The password is generated by CBRE and I can't seem to change it, so I always look it up.  3.The app hasn't been letting me login or when I do sometimes I can't open the work order. 4.At invoicing, there was no Equipment category to bill for, nor did I have a choice for Apprentice under labor. I need these 4 categories to bill: Labor, Materials, Equipment, Trip charge."
fmPilot2,notes 
fmPilot2,Maybe find when payments were made eaiser
fmPilot2,Not at this time
fmPilot2,Option to move to the next step for all at the same time would be helpful. I have to do each one at a time.
fmPilot2," It does not notify the work order manager if we reply on Fmpilot, It only does When we reply on the email.  -It does not autosave the quotes. This should be improved.  -It is difficult to create new users."
fmPilot2,The search could be better.
fmPilot2,"Sometimes there will be miscommunications between the center, CBRE and the techs/company that show up on site"
fmPilot2,have it default to my location when I open instead of needing to choose every time
fmPilot2,Yall need to get the right people in to do the repair not the cheapest you can find
fmPilot2,be more user friendly
fmPilot2,Provide updates for work orders that have been open a long time.
fmPilot2,"It is INCREDIBLY complicated, for NO REASON. We work with lots of other providers who use online billing systems, and it is SO SIMPLE; really intuitively obvious. This system is IMPOSSIBLE. Seriously."
fmPilot2,Fix you IVR call in system. 
fmPilot2,"It doesn't seem like certain work orders take priority over others.  Someone can put in a work order for HIGH priority and it takes just as a long as a medium or even low priority.  Same thing with Emergency work orders.  It's an emergency for a reason.  

There has been several occasions when someone comes out to do a work order and we'll get a follow up call about it, we explain to them the situation but an actual follow up never gets done. Instead it gets ""completed"" in the system when it's not. 

The system as far as trying to put in a work order is relatively easily.  However, some jobs seem to be hidden under certain categories.  I.e. compactor pickup is under waste and not compactor/bailer.   "
fmPilot2,It works great. 
fmPilot2,We're not able to reset the password
fmPilot2,It is not the most intuitive program.
fmPilot2,"make it easier to search by customer name/number. also, it's not always clear if an email is getting sent when notes are left in the portal. and when notes are saved in the portal they go unread by CBRE"
fmPilot2,"some times you are limited on how to create a work order because what you are trying to do a work order for is not listed, need to add a section for other ares that might not be showing   "
fmPilot2,It's honestly been really difficult navigating this portal. It's very unclear and doesn't work a lot of the time when trying to process an invoice.
fmPilot2,It is not user friendly. Always getting denied on invoices for one reason or another and it was very difficult to get set up and started in the beginning which created more work for us 
fmPilot2,By not adding DNE so that techs see it
fmPilot2,"application is very slow, takes a while to load workorders."
fmPilot2,"More specifics, adding Vehicle Maintenance or Garage as problem areas would aid In simplifying work orders."
fmPilot2,Nothing at the moment 
fmPilot2,"processing speed
reporting
search

"
fmPilot2,hard to use and understand 
fmPilot2,Get FM Pilot to stop logging me off after 15 minutes of non use.
fmPilot2,Have vendors complete work orders
fmPilot2,"Just not a user friendly format, confusing.  Need to be able to chat for support. "
fmPilot2,make it more user friendly and easier to navigate.
Mosaic,
Mosaic,Equipment tagging does not work properly. Mosaic tags the wrong tags or sites on incidents.
Mosaic,"In regards to the UI, I have no complaints. Sometimes I come across mosaic tickets that are mislabeled, the alarm details and source info will not match the mosaic ticket title. I believe this is more of a programming or routing setup issue though. "
Mosaic,"Mainly on Zendesk, the alarm title site doesn't match the site that the alarm is actually coming from. Mosaic is also slow to load most of the time. I have to refresh my browser after making changes as sometimes they won't initially take. 

I do love the timer that Mosaic allows us to set on alarms as well as creating the SI7 WO from Mosaic. 

Overall i think it's a great addition and tool that simply needs some adjustments. "
Mosaic,it is flashy - only as good as the data that is being put in
Mosaic,"I am unable to find any training tutorials or videos, the training should be available via Talent coach. "
Mosaic,None at this time.
Mosaic,When it comes to setting the status of a Mosaic alarm I think it gets a little clunky. Like we should e able to select the status and select the date that it will complete. 
Mosaic,"When a service work order is created under insight - no work order number is given - only the word pending is seen. We are unable to reference what the work order number is for documentation. Without the actual work order number - we have to search in SI7, however I am not sure if the pending ever updates in Mosaic either. I have not seen it but I have not checked in 24 hour increments either."
Site IQ,I'd suggest add a section for Master-planned communities; Also make it easier to (this sounds horrible) to delete/clean up information.
Site IQ,"Add the ability to put a star for the existing location on the map.  
Enable different file types to be uploaded.  As example DRG CAD files  This makes the tool a data resource for the client and its easy to populate a full file for each building"
Site IQ,"Great product.  if we can make it a bit more users friendly, it would be great."
Site IQ,
Site IQ,The brokers have requested a field for the total monthly rent (Asking Rate and OpEx combined)
fmPilot2,"Identifying where to create invoice, itemize and submit is not intuiative.  The only thing that is easy to do is add attachments. "
Site IQ,"when entering a property in the system, if it does not exist currently, allow to modify the information rather than having to start over when inputting mapping coordinates would save a little time"
Site IQ,I am in early stages learning how to use this tool
Site IQ,"Properties change all the time -- names, addresses (weird, but true), sizes, ownership, etc. Since Site IQ is tied into surveys, I cannot just delete a line of building information and upload a new one through Excel. Please make it easy to use software, and not manual labor, to upload updates. I am sure I am not alone. Also, since so much of the same data is being used for Dimension, it would be ideal to just upload information to one location and instantly update both at once. Maybe include a couple yes/no columns for whether the information needs to upload to Site IQ, Dimension or both."
Site IQ,"We can add the ability to insert logo, and create an overlay system, similar to demisions."
Site IQ,Sometimes when I add a column it doesn't show up in the proof and I have to go back to the beginning to add it. 
Site IQ,"Adding properties is pretty time intensive. If the properties were already in here with clear height info it would make it a lot easier. Or at least when I start adding a property, have it recognize that the property is already in here. Because right now I just add every building."
Site IQ,When I do a lot of inputting and working in the site for a while it locks up or gets so incredibly slow and non-responsive.
Site IQ,New mapping slows down the system a lot!
Site IQ,"It would be nice to have an option to ""de-dupe"" after importing from CoStar. I always save the most recent import (because I know the flyer and other graphics are the most up-to-date versions) but then have to go back and delete the older versions of the property in the data set, to keep it clean and obvious which one is the corrected version."
Site IQ,"1. It would be great if there was a way to remove property names from the map when generating the deliverable. Not all properties have names so the address is just displayed twice.
2.  In the Property Comparison section, we should have the capability to decide how many properties should fit on one page. 
3.  We should have the ability to produce our own cover page photos, as we did in previous versions of Site IQ. 
4. We should be able to upload all brochures and images, and site plans at one time, just like what we do with the excel for the other information. It's very time consuming to have to do them all individually. At least we should be able to upload multiple property photos at once instead of individually. "
Site IQ,The ability to collaborate/share with other teams so that we are not duplicating efforts. 
Site IQ,Love Site IQ! Here is some feedback that I hope is helpful. There is a very bad site lag when opening/closing properties at times or when the map is trying to calculate a location. This has caused my browser to freeze and for me to lose a property I am working on adding.
Site IQ,"Create an undo button
Mass upload that can over write the previous data
Numerical cell shows warning if the input is not number"
Site IQ,Please allow the ability to share properties and surveys with other people including the flyers and images.
Site IQ,Increase integration with Market IQ and Deal IQ.
Site IQ,It would be great to have two teams and they both have access.  Also would be nice to change headings. My one broker wants me to use this for comps so I will see how it goes.
Site IQ,"The ability to add and remove team members to a project is the biggest obstacle with the functionality of the application. As we upload information about a site, it would be great if the information is added to a master database that is accessible to everyone. This should reduce redundancy and can save everyone a lot of time."
Site IQ,Ability to share surveys across teams/individuals.
Site IQ,Thank you!
Site IQ,"It would be great to add the following columns: Rent Abatement, Signage Opportunities, Common Area Factor, & ESG Initiatives

Also, it would be helpful to be able to click on the stock image of the property in the table and be able to add the photo there, in addition to the attachment column. It would be more user-friendly. 

Also, being able to add multiple photos, attachments, and flyers at once would make the process more efficient.

Thank you! "
Site IQ,I work on multiple teams and would like the ability to edit surveys across teams.
Site IQ,"A couple of tweaks need to happen, i.e. changing dot colors for the map, being able to identify a current location (i.e. star, different colored icon, etc), radius rings. Also, a big big point point for my team is importing an excel and having it override the prior property entry photo / flyer / site plan. It is vey time consuming to have to re-add these items everytime you export / import an excel. Also, we thought the multiple links issue was updated only to find that when you create a survey and have edits to it, you have to issue a new link if the adjustments are to the property details.. which 9 times out of 10 they are vs. the final deliverable edits. We find we are issuing multiple survey links and it gets very confusing and chaotic on the back end. Our brokers wont do all the edits in site iq, so the excel seems to be the best way but for a large survey it is a big lift to readd the property flyers and site plans again. Also, the PDFs created are always wayyyyy to large to send to clients.. Thanks! "
Site IQ,"Allow Client Services users to have access to more than one Site IQ account. Example - I support six individual brokers, none of whom are on a team together. "
Site IQ,It would be helpful to be able to mass upload data again via Excel without losing attachments - like if we added a unique ID that linked them together. 
Site IQ,photos are cut off when you put them for building photos on the survey  -@ when you download it to be a PDF it does not take you to the first page-@ takes you to the middle of the document  -@in a future update can the zip codes auto flll when you put in the address? -@need more cover photos for office  -@ ability to the remove the team section on the side if you do not want to display a team  -@if a building is under construction sometimes we dont have a address so the ability to just put a name and a approx location without having to put a address
Site IQ,I want to be able to work on SiteIQ with different partners on different projects. This is not possible the way the current SiteIQ team situation is set up. I would also like to be able to use different colors on the map for different sets of buildings on the same map. (example: rail-served vs. non-rail-served options)
Site IQ,When adding a property and moving the location - we need to be able to view that mode with an aerial view map. Right now it is grey scale and very hard to pinpoint exact locations. 
Site IQ,"Thank you for continuing improving it. Is there any way to search the field when Edit Columns? Also, if two buildings are sharing the same addresses with same square footage, is there any way we can have a duplicate warning?"
Site IQ,no
Site IQ,"-I think for deleting images, there should be a confirmation before deleting. 

-I think that there should be more autonomy in labeling sections within the end result for Deliverables. I'd love to see a Reserved, Unreserved tab for parking. 

-Being able to upload our own images for Survey title page would also helpful. We are currently performing a survey for an energy company and there are no stock images that fit that criteria. 

-It would also be helpful to be able to scale images to different sizes and change font. "
Site IQ,Include heat maps for income and population density.
Site IQ,"Nothing immediate.  Super helpful platform; and so easy to get help from Kate and other team members.  Thank you!
"
Site IQ,"improve map functions, be able to add other relevant info to maps, such as current client location "
Site IQ,"The page is constantly saying it is unresponsive.
"
Site IQ,"Please add more data fields with land information so we can use site iq for our site selection projects:
Zoning
Acres
Land SF
Topography
Rail
Available Utilities	
Electric
Water
Gas
Sewer
Storm Drain
Internet
Water Service	
Sewer Type	
"
Site IQ,"Needed Improvements to SiteIQ:
1) Need to be able to customize fields in the Team Data section. Not after you click on the deliverables page. 
2) Need to recognize duplicate inputs. This is a must for the site going forward.
3) Being able to customize the pins before the deliverables page would be helpful. 
4) Using the search tool bar on the team data can be finicky. Sometimes the properties will not pull up. "
Site IQ,"Team members should be able to collaborate like a Google Doc. Is that possible?
"
Site IQ,"Time to load is extremely painful.  I know you are working on a solution, but please implement as quickly as possible.  We have several thousand records and the system constaintly freezes up."
Site IQ,It would be great to have a duplicate feature to notify when properties have already been uploaded into the data base and gives an option to update the property with the current information. Also would be great you have field verbiage to upload comps
Site IQ,The site tends to glitch often and input of data has been lost at times. Autosave would be helpful without having to click an actual save button. 
Site IQ,"Please roll this out for office as well, this is a great product and truly makes CBRE a market leader. "
Site IQ,"Allow me to use Excel to upload mass changes so I don't have hunt and peck to get to the information I need to change. For instance, when Prologis took over Duke. It would have been nice to have the database key to reference and the ability to make the change in the ownership column."
Site IQ,Yes  Those have been provided to the development team.
Site IQ,figure out a way to be able to easily duplicate core data for availabilities within the same building.
Site IQ,"Enlarge map within property profile.  Reduce whitespace in Property Details to accommodate.  

When opening flyers system is very slow.  Landscape orientation isn't ideal for flyers as most are portrait.  "
Site IQ,Improve the import function with better matching of columns from CoStar exports.
Site IQ,So many. Janice & I are working on a list. :D
Site IQ,Integrate with Dimension :)
Site IQ,Still learning; ask me again in 30 days!
Site IQ,More office specific options- such as adding multiple suites available within one building
Site IQ,"The only thing I've noticed is my surveys tend to slow down significantly (on the back end) after about 50 properties. I have to enter things in multiple times for it to process, and it freezes/glitches a lot more. Everything runs smoothly on the client end, but it's tougher to work with. "
Site IQ,I have sent a list with along with Janice Reckers of ideas we had to improve Site IQ. Some have already been implemented. Thank you very much for taking our feedback seriously.
Site IQ,"The ability to have multiple templated columns saved for different types of surveys would be exceedingly helpful. Also, in the customization of the column name, just a blank option before the deliverable would also make things a lot easier. Right now we're working around it but it is a bit cumbersome to repeat the necessary process every single survey. Thanks site iq team, great stuff."
Site IQ,"The ability to move the location markers in the map would be helpful. Also the ability to use it for Land, not only industrial"
Site IQ,It would be nice to be able to move the property markers on the map within a project/deliverable because sometimes they overlap and can cover up each other. 
Site IQ,"Really love it. Will the copyright year be updated to 2023? (appears at the bottom of the map page, property comparison and overview pages)"
Site IQ,"Limitations on the Mapping - would like to color code the property numbers but there is no way to add what those colors mean. 
Roof & Lighting appear to be missing from building details. "
Site IQ,"1. can we add more cover photos?  It would be great if we could add our own for the online version. 
2. Can you add a life sciences cover photo?
3. When is the next training for a current user? I have learned a few quirks as a I go, but training would be great.
4. Logos- it would be nice to be able to add the clients logo as a png/no background.
"
Site IQ,"Radius rings on Map from designated area.   Ability to ad key points via Dimension (UPS/FedEx Hubs, Ports etc. Ability to copy property so imputing all details for multi-building sites is not necessary"
Site IQ,Still would like to see different team access.
Site IQ,Sometimes all the columns don't show up on the deliverables page when I make an edit and I have to recreate the survey
Site IQ,"- There is a bit of a glitch with clear height that was not there before -- ex: you have to type in 32' twice  or a 0 will show up on pdf.  - Filing system for projects - It would be nice to see when and property details were updated (not just added) - ""Favorite"" filter presets  - Formatting in cbre one is not as professional as the original site iq (ex: additional photos) - Adding other broker's names to autofill"
Site IQ,1. Ability to add a current location to the map without having to add the building into the comparison. 2. Ability to add radius rings to the map. 3. Ability to add notes for a specific event (i.e. tour) that wouldn't carry over to the whole database.
Site IQ,Only disadvantage is having to upload all the properties.  Lots of data entry.  Would love radius rings!
Site IQ,I wish it was also available for retail and office properties.
Site IQ,I would like the ability to duplicate projects.  Also the ability to store broker names so I don't have to add them each time I create a project. 
Site IQ,"Unlike a lot of other teams and markets our size, we have an inordinate number of industrial buildings we monitor and keep in Site IQ for surveys. The problem is Site IQ is geared to a one-and-done entry, which means if we want to add more data to previously unused columns or change information -- such as whether a building is under construction, has a new owner, etc., we have to MANUALLY make the change. We have about 500 buildings in Site IQ. If we only used Site IQ for everything, that wouldn't be too hard. However, we use Dimension and other tools, too. It is impractical to have to hand-key in everything. Give me the key for each of our buildings in the Site IQ system and allow me to upload changes from Excel. Then I could help the brokers with sales projects and spend less time on unnecessary manual labor."
Site IQ,Expand it for all product types  Make the interface between CoStar and SiteIQ easier.  Populate all the Class A buildings in each market as a starting point.  Have the option of keeping changes and alterations personal to a survey or global to the master building record.
Site IQ,"1. project dashboard: if you make duplicate it would be great to duplicate it as a brand new project not under an existing project. 
2. Column edits, it would be great to have common templates that we can create. not every project has all line items needed to be displayed. 
3. when entering the line item information, it is very time consuming to constantly go up and down on the page to enter things in. it would be great if we could choose the standard info so it shows closer at the top of the viewing page. "
Site IQ,As I use it more I will make suggestions.  It's great you remain open to new ideas.  Thanks!
Site IQ,Speed and reducing the size of reports.
Site IQ,Please make available to us the key and a template so we can upload changes to our properties without having to endlessly manually key data into Site IQ. (e.g. changing listings from Duke to Prologis when Prologish acquired Duke.
Site IQ,"The speed of open each tab is slow.
When export the data, it has duplicate columns."
Site IQ,"I was having some system issues, but Kate and Rick have been so helpful. I really appreciate all of there help. Made my day a little brighter, so thanks to both of you!"
Site IQ,"I'd like to save the columns for deliverables. Also, it would be nice to make changes to a property and not need to regenerate a new deliverable and need to select the columns every time. "
Site IQ,I would like the ability to move the project folder or pin the active folders to the top of the list. The Team Data page is cluttered with properties and it would be useful to have an availabilities folders we can move properties in and out of as they get leased. 
Site IQ,The list of properties and availabilities are significantly out of date. Many properties have to be added manually. Not necessarily quick and easy to use on the fly. 
Site IQ,"Add multiple layers of search criteria.  For example, if under ""Status"" I would like to see buildings that are existing AND under construction, that is two separate searches.  "
Site IQ,Different report or export options.  It would be great if we could get a report that gives like an availability snapshot - 9 properties to a page with a photo and editable fields.
Site IQ,"Like to have more export options.  Like to have additional search filters. Also would like the ability to filter for brokerage.  I don't even think we have a column for it.
Love what you've done so far!  Thanks!"
Site IQ,I think you are working on it but the ability to back save changes made to survey output to team records but on an opt in basis. (eg. opt not to change record when you save!
Site IQ,Seems like very few Broker teams have their properties listed in here.  When I do searches for competing properties nothing comes up.  Thx!
Site IQ,"SiteIQ drops commas when I import from excel.

When setting up custom fields during import several just never make it - OPEX & date available.

It would be great it is save the custom fields I regularly use. 

It would be better if it was ""asking rate"" and not ""asking rent"""
Site IQ,It would be nice if there was a way to convert available buildings to leased or sold comps and the two be under different headings.  Also would be great if it were more useful for raw land.  Different headings and ability to outline (draw) a site.
Site IQ,"Upload multiple photos/files at once.
Need custom column names"
Site IQ,It would be easy to renumber the order of properties desired rather than drag and drop to its desired placement. Sometimes it can take some time with the map reconfiguring after each placement. 
Site IQ,The best! We need to promote its use for all product types and make it a differentiator in winning tenant rep business
Site IQ,Site IQ often cuts off my words when I'm typing in property fields quickly and the program times out a lot and gives me error messages.  
Site IQ,"I love SiteIQ and how easy it is to send surveys, get feedback, and convert to a tour package. However, it's not user friendly at all. There are a lot of duplicated/similar fields that are tricky to figure out. Once figured out, it does get a little easier...  "
Site IQ,"We currently use siteiq to provide info on buildings for sale or lease (primarily Office) for clients. Would be great to be able to have a way to set up templates that we could choose, whereby each template would pull in specific data points that we typically use (right now, address info isn't typically something that's turned on when we go into a project, and a lot of industrial data points are)."
Site IQ,"So pleased with my first project, it took a while but it looks amazing!"
Site IQ,"Hi,

Below are some of the things I am having trouble with:

- Typing in words and it erases letters
- An adjustment to a property in the survey not populating the team data
- Pictures take a lot of time to upload and sometimes they do not show.



"
Site IQ,The site is not clear.  I just entered a new property into the site and now it is nowhere to be found.  I find the has has given me a lot of anxiety to learn especially when there is a deadline p[ending.  Plus the site is slow and wasn't functioning earlier today. 
Site IQ,"Improvements are needed. Saving column order, being able to edit a project and still maintaining the same code for viewing link, heat map feature, to name a few."
Site IQ,"We were on a phone call with Rick and discussed the many things that the site needed to change. Locating duplicates, being able to share data with people outside of your team, and other things that were discussed in our meeting."
Site IQ,"Maybe in the property upload process, be able to upload a duplicate and have the system identify the duplicate and ideally not create the duplicate property. "
Site IQ,the deliverable won't always open when needing to edit which causes issues.
Site IQ,"Duplicate detection, sharing or collaborating on a survey with other users that are not on your team"
Site IQ,"There seems to be an issue where my browser will have delays loading or will freeze up as the page is loading slow. Super weird and has been happening for a while, unsure of the cause. Otherwise, I love Site IQ"
Site IQ,not right now
Site IQ,Making it easier to merge projects. 
Site IQ,This is all geared towards Industrial and we have office properties too.
Site IQ,I find it easier to upload properties via excel but then i get a lot of duplicate properties because i dont want to hand type in all the updated info for each property every time. Is there anyway to combine properties? So i dont have to reupload the images every time? I also hate that once you make the survey you cant edit the properties unless you edit directly on the survey
Site IQ,Please add a functionality to make the survey specific to OFFICE or INDUSTRIAL
Site IQ,"I'm sure I do, but I can't think of any right now."
Site IQ,I wish there was an option to add another property comparison section or be able to add lease/sale comps. It also would be good if you could combine projects. 
Site IQ,I wish there was a way to crop photos when you upload your own cover photos. Sometimes when it shows on the cover page its cut off. It would be nice to be able to move the photo into a better position so it's not cut off.
Site IQ,"The actual tool is awesome which is why I use it, but the way the fields are set up can be confusing. Also, the way the information funnels from the property pages to the deliverable makes it clunky. "
Site IQ,when you upload photos- they shouldn't cut off half way - should auto adjust to fit in the frame 
Site IQ,"yes, the ability to add to marked location on the map would be great for refence for our clients.  E.g. their facility compared to available options "
ServiceInsight,Letting us do field PO's while the work order is open. Letting us have pictures after the work order has been closed. Letting us add field PO's after the work order has been closed. Letting us still add notes after the work orders been closed.
ServiceInsight,"More user friendly, does not flow.  Reports are cumbersome to populate.  "
ServiceInsight,It's a tool that would be hard to do my job without. Thanks
ServiceInsight,The platform is very useful for addressing work orders.
ServiceInsight,
ServiceInsight,no
ServiceInsight,"Some features ideally would be dataloadable that are currently not. Attaching documents to equipment tags, or the details of contact IDs for example."
ServiceInsight,Please don't change it!
ServiceInsight,It would be helpful to have an option to add attachments and add a tag when creating the work order. You need to create the work order and then go back in it to add an attachment and tag
ServiceInsight,"The Request Dashboard is a good service in submitting work to be completed, however if the Matrix is not setup properly this can lead to work orders going to companies that are not in my state. I would like to see the name of the company along side the Primary/Secondary matrix in the dispatching tool. Because this does not exist, I have to use the Main Portal to reassign the job to the correct vendor."
ServiceInsight,Loading time for assignment data right now is terrible on imfm. It can take a couple minutes to load and if I'm busy and the screen times out i have to start over again
ServiceInsight,I'm unable to view just my current and past requests. The website shows every request from other users as well. 
ServiceInsight,The SIREQUEST App and iMFM app doesnt allow the client/users to enter Priority parameters for work orders. When vantage analytics reports are run it looks like the team doesnt close out work orders in time because of the set priority code. 
ServiceInsight,"Make a team of Facility managers and technicians (workshop), getter data, and deployments on which way the program can make statistical deployments of tickets (cause, time duration, etc...). PowerBI has the same possibility to constantly take automatic data and transfer it into charts which can be by local area presented. MyVantage is great for keeping KPIs in check, but we need statistics to be proactive and to reduce the time for which we consume in finding the biggest cause of failures for our tickets. The overall system is ok, put have space to be great.   "
ServiceInsight,somehow making history searches easier.
ServiceInsight,MFM  needs a total overhall. 
ServiceInsight,Search for work orders needs to be narrowed down.
ServiceInsight,I feel that the main UI could really do with an uplift to look slicker and cleaner like the other CMMS competitors such as Maximo. 
ServiceInsight,No comments as to improvement of the system since my use is very limited.
ServiceInsight,"SI has a lot of bugs still, even after the crash and update. Need to work on being better and user friendly."
ServiceInsight,SI7 is difficult to navigate thru it does not use standard wildcard nor was it developed with the end user in mind the training provided is subpar at best and LOGCHECK is better!
ServiceInsight,"Maybe is lack of training, but there are certain tools that I'm still have difficult to use or understand."
ServiceInsight,I think it one of th worst systems I've use and there are so many out there that work better and do more 
ServiceInsight,The JSA for the PM jobs for my engineers are not applicable for their task.  The only option they have is Open / Complete.  The option N/A needs to be added so that we are truly filling them out correctly.  Right now you have to select complete to get it to show as closed. 
ServiceInsight,I haven't used anything else. So I have no complaints 
ServiceInsight,"Less nuances to make simple changes.  For example, closing a building requires work to be done at all four levels of the location hierarchy, attached matrices and employee records.  This requires various data loads and back and forth between numerous screens."
ServiceInsight,Make it load faster
ServiceInsight,It would be nice if there were a master list of manufacturers and models that covered all clients. We often get junk from the field in those two fields and have to do all sorts of cleanup.
ServiceInsight,"Hola,he entrado pero necesito las atribuciones de supervisor para poder abrir tickets y cerrarlos. Tambien en la aplicacion mobil amfm los tecnicos a cargo no han podido accesar y no se ven reflejados los reportes para poderlos visualizar"
ServiceInsight,Overall I find it quite straigh forward to use with no unnecessary frills. 
ServiceInsight,"There are way too many buttons and options and the program should be simplified for the type of WO and or the role. There are multiple ways to do similar things on SI and it makes it complicated. training is terrible or non existent and it is one of the main programs used a CBRE. I receive more training on how to use a ladder, which I never use that I have with Service  Insight. "
ServiceInsight,Answer to question 1 = all of the above
ServiceInsight,My clients have been sending their requests to the iopropertyservices@cbre.com email address in order to get a work order number.  I understand it takes 24 hours but lately it has been taking a couple days for a simple access card request.  Can you make the emails that clients/tenants use to sent requests consistent?  A lot of clients/tenants still use the phone number and email for work order requests instead of the PSL website and are not willing to use the website because they've been using phone number and email method for 15+ years
ServiceInsight,I would like to have additional access to view all work orders for a particular facility that I oversee. 
ServiceInsight,It can be really slow to use.
ServiceInsight,The system is very slow Also it seems to log out randomly sometimes at last 3 times a day.  When a quick list is run and then you try to do another it logs out 
ServiceInsight,"would be great if i could receive email notifications each time an employee opens a ticket for us. without emails, i have to refresh the page all the time just to make sure we don't have anything pending"
ServiceInsight,Never had proper training on how to use it I've had to fumble through it on my own. Parts but I do not like once I look up a work order when I try to go back I got to re-submit everything for a particular building when I'm trying to do a site history
ServiceInsight,No
ServiceInsight,"Difficult to enter requests.  Too many steps. Difficult to run all reports.  Parameter input is beyond difficult. If you want to print out a work order you have to turn it into a pdf first.  Too many steps. I have worked in several other Work Order/PM/Asset systems that are ""light years"" better than service insight.  I would not recommend to anyone."
ServiceInsight,I would like to see the mobile MFM app have more streamlined controls for the tech in the field. 
ServiceInsight,ServiceInsight works very well with my account and is very compatible. Very easy to learn and communicate with other subcontractors. 
ServiceInsight,Further training on how to assist vendors with their end of the portal. Further training on how to run reports and best utilize them. 
ServiceInsight,More video training 
ServiceInsight,The web page loads too slowly.  Honeywell customers should have a prompt to enter their email instead of Username.
ServiceInsight,For 6 1/2 years I directly worked in Si7 and after getting use to it was pretty much like second nature to me. I no longer have that job so I am not in it as much anymore. I can tell you that it can be very complicated for users and I feel like it has alot  of quirks
ServiceInsight,Problem code improvements. Many times the customer will not find an accurate problem code. 
ServiceInsight,You have to click around for certain buttons that could be on the first page since are used so frequently.  Also I find ServiceInsight to be slow.
ServiceInsight,"Direct every request for my team directly to me. Skip the FC, and FM. It sits in their queue at times . Lost time I need to meet SLA."
ServiceInsight,"Navigation is brutal.  Toggling back a screen is awful and you have to start completely over again.  Ex: Site history - list populates - dive into WO, back out and have to re-enter parameters again, instead of going to the previous screen"
ServiceInsight,The update of the BUILDING INSPECTIONS SURVEY every 3 months minimum and also that the suppliers can mark as completed a WO when it is assigned to them. Regarding the SMALL WORKS there is a problem to generate the PO in automatic this we have to create it manually and then link it to the WO.
ServiceInsight,"After 6:30am CST SI is very very slow, somedays it takes a long time to access SI and remains that way throughout the day. "
ServiceInsight,Nope
ServiceInsight,"The overall performance is poor the web pages take a long time to load. The controls used in the pages to save, reassign and to make changes are also very slow. "
ServiceInsight,"I have worked with and built several WO/PM programs. This program is SLOW and not user friendly. We have had it for a year and still do not have a working PM Program that matches what I have asked for. The auto-dispatch make no sense. The Problem codes make no sense. This system is under par for technology and over par for being outdated. I have real input if someone would like it, but unless someone is willing to listen, it just sounds like complaints."
ServiceInsight,"ServiceInsight is a powerful tool.  At the technician level, efficiency and ease of use should be the priority.  In many cases technicians are now spending a portion of their time entering data to Si7.  The goal should be to minimize data entry time and maximize wrench time.  Allow administrators and managers to retain the very powerful tools that are available in Si7.  I would go at it like Nest did with the thermostat.  No one thought thermostats needed to be changed.  Nest approached it with simplicity in mind and it revolutionized thinking about how people interact with a product. "
ServiceInsight,"Invoice submission into Service Insight is an issue for some vendors due to employee change over, getting access to the system for a new employee at the vendor.  If we had access at times we could help the vendor while they wait for the access to the system.  The last system Corrigo we did have access and it helped with keeping invoices being processed more efficient especially when the vendor emails you the invoice copy asking for help., Just a thought"
ServiceInsight,System needs to be streamlined. Too many steps to create/edit/close/pull data/ make corrections. 
ServiceInsight,The mobile app is terrible and could be a very useful tool if it was made better.
ServiceInsight,For On call weekends make it so the person on call only receives P1s and P2s. 
ServiceInsight,"MAKE IT MORE USER FRIENDLY.  TOO MANY POINTLESS DROP DOWN BOXES.  ALSO, SYSTEM CRASHED DOZENS OF TIMES EACH DAY FOR NO REASON.  VERY SLOW TO PROCESS AND MOVE FROM SCREEN TO SCREEN.  "
ServiceInsight,Remove the additional OK buttons and be allowed to conduct multiple tasks within the same frame or screen 
ServiceInsight,N/A
ServiceInsight,Over a week to reset a password. Very Upsetting and disappointing with SUPPORT I getting. The same support I got when your system went drop for over a month earlier this year. 
ServiceInsight,"Should have an option to close multiple work orders, especially those works related to each other, PM works that was done simultaneously."
ServiceInsight,When I try to look up vendor work orders it doesn't give me what I need
ServiceInsight,The system is less intuitive than other WO systems I have used in the past.
ServiceInsight,remember basic personal details somehow. having to enter my cell phone number for each ticket is painful. 
ServiceInsight,"As a manager for such a large company, the recent large outage and the many short outages with the main portal and MFM are concerning. It seems like the company values its other sectors over facilities maintenance and as a result SI7 lacks the personnel resources to make it more reliable and effective. Its such an important tool for my and my teams daily use but it often feels like its taken for granted.  "
ServiceInsight,"SEVICE INSIGHT MAY BE ALOT BETTER THAN MY EXPERIENCES WITH IT, I BELEIVE  MY TRAINING WAS REALLY LACK LUSTER. SO MOST OF THIS SITE IS FORIEGN TO ME. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A WAY ENGINEERS FROM THE FEILD COULD INPUT INFO ON NEW EQUIPMENT OR JUST EQUIPMENT IN GENERAL INTO SI7 INSTEAD OF WAITING EMAILING INFO TO ANOTHER PERSON TO COMPLETE BECAUSE WE IN THE FEILD ARE VISUALLY ONSITE WITH THE EQUIPMENT. BELIEVE WE IN THE FEILD WOULD GIVE BETTER DISCRIPTION AND LOCATION AS WELL AS FILL IN ALL THE BLANKS I SEE IN THE LOCATION AND INFO FEILDS. AND TRAINING, TRAINING, TRAINING. MAYBE SOME CLASSES ON TALENT COACH INSTEAD OF REPEATING THE SAME CLASSES EVERY YEAR"
ServiceInsight,gets to complicated or confusing with all the dropdowns and choices. I don't use 80% what what's there and never will. also the program has a tendency of dropping out or closing while in the middle of work (timing out). 
ServiceInsight,It would be better if the locations were available for all employee houses and detachments. 
ServiceInsight,"I use it as I have to, not because I want to."
ServiceInsight,we currently have to create work order them go back in through view modify so we can attach equipment tag so extra steps
ServiceInsight,I am offering that information during the UAT testing for Jarvis. 
ServiceInsight,DO NOT MOVE FORWARD WITH JARVIS. We are one of the accounts testing it and it is the absolute worst. Please just improve SI similar to how it occurred when we changed from SI 6 to Si 7.
ServiceInsight,"I would recommend clearing the vendors that we no longer used to be removed.   Need to update some GL codes, they do not match to request. "
ServiceInsight,In general is one tool complet
ServiceInsight,Pms and scheduling dates are not correct It would be Great if we could create our own Pms. Be able to assign more then one technician to a work order
ServiceInsight,My account has switched from IMFM to the Carrigo. We no longer use IMFM and it is missed. I thought IMFM was a better service tool for work orders. Carrigo is owned by a competitor of CBRE and I feel the competition is purposefully sabotaging our efforts to maintain the Wells Fargo account 
ServiceInsight,"First off, we need better and more categories. My job is different from other sites and what I do on a daily basis is not in the system. I submit my own work orders and it is difficult to put them in with the wrong categories. There needs to be a category for mail and packages. Also need a category for escorting contractors."
ServiceInsight,I do not have sufficient access level to use this tool to its potential as I have with MP2 and other CMMS systems.
ServiceInsight,"It is frustrating that more than one person can't be in a work order. The WO gets locked and then you can't make edits.  PO information that goes with the WO is a hassle to track down. Something more seamless or easier to get to would be better (possible PO# listed in the ""log"") CPI status should trigger a notification/email to the FC or FM for work to be inspected.  Re-send option for CAT5 approval emails to the client - or auto re-send after 24/36 hours without acknowledgement of the request. Added CAS field where the Activity/BOMA code can be selected prior to PRL - The Activity/BOMA codes do not align with every budget BOMA code based on the WO  description/problem. Being able to select all the financial information prior to PRL would make for less edits on PO's.  "
ServiceInsight,"There's a lot to learn about SI7. It has a lot of perks and just as many glitches. I'm a computer savvy person and it's still a difficult application for me to navigate. I will say, like with anything, the more time invested using the app the easier its become to manage. This is in direct response to the difficulty of SI7.   The app doesn't populate everything that is requested. I often have to hit refresh on the browser when i bring up my call list because it doesn't bring up all of my WOs. I've entered a CAS to create a PO and the PO doesn't generate in coupa. Just things like that would help if they were cleaned up. Maybe streamline the app better. Make a GUI for each level of clearance as far as access to the app. So a tech's GUI would look different than an FM/FC. Not just making the links inaccessible. "
ServiceInsight,"User feedback: Not easy or intuitive to fill in problem code and other drop downs - takes too long to search for an appropriate choice and so some users just end of selecting anything randomly.  No way to flag as urgent and no indication of how long you should expect service to be provided.  Sometimes you get an email after quite some time has passed that tells you your service date is several weeks from then.  No message to tell you to call instead of use the website if it is an emergency - this is a problem  Emails that say your request is complete typically have no information as to what was done - just say ""complete""  Attaching files/pictures is clunky and when I ask the CBRE person if they saw it they often say ""no"" - clunky for them as well?  Should add ""Building Exterior"" and ""Roof"" to Floor selection drop down"
ServiceInsight,It's very slow to create WO's and navigate SI
ServiceInsight,"Not the most user friendly when creating a WO, Trying to ensure we have the right caller infomation is hard to confirm by email address, It would be great if we could pull caller information by their EID number assigned to them by our clients instead. When creating a request Trying to find the site in question is tricky, If there was a search feature to locate the site my their mail or location code would help."
ServiceInsight,SI7 is a big component to getting our work done. The biggest issue iv'e had is being locked out for 10+ days with limited ability to perform my job. I feel local admins should have reset/lockout permissions back to help streamline our issues.
ServiceInsight,Filters to select WO's from different aspects don't work sometimes properly. I would improve that as well as reporting section fort he specific sites. 
ServiceInsight,If there was an option to open work orders in a new browser window when selecting them from a loaded site search screen that would be great.  The way it is now if I am looking for a specific work order if I click on one from the list and it's not the one I'm looking for every time I hit the back button I must rerun the site search.
ServiceInsight,After 8 AM Central Time service insight is slow to load. Having to wait for new screen to load can be frustrating at times. 
ServiceInsight,condense the job step process. Ability to stay logged into mobile tech IMFM app rather than being logged out when closing app. Less steps to see closed work orders on mobile app and desktop app. 
ServiceInsight,"In iMFM have the work orders change color as they get closer to the due dates. Green when they are on time, yellow as they approach the due date, and red when they late. "
ServiceInsight,I WOULD LIKE FOR SI7 TO COMMUNICATE MORE WITH COUPA. CHANGES THAT ARE MADE IN SI7 I WOULD LIKE FOR IT TO FLOW TO COUPA
ServiceInsight,"I only use the iMFM portal, not SI portal. One thing i would like to have improved in iMFM is when creating multiple self-generated completed work orders in a row. I can search the key word for the first one just fine, but when I go to create a second one right after the first, the key word(s) do not show. I then have to close iMFM, log back in, and then create the new self-gen completed work order. It's a bit annoying having to do this process. I feel this is an area where improvement would be appreciated. Thank you."
ServiceInsight,"The system is clunky, kicks you out often while working and there are areas that definitely could use some updating to make users jobs easier. It often feels very outdated."
ServiceInsight,Not very intuitive for picking correct categories.  On my mobile and desktop it doesn't remember me and I have to go through long log in's each time which is frustrating.  
ServiceInsight,"Users are locked out frequently requiring assistance in e-mailing service desk for unlocks and submitting new passwords, etc. Then, due to the changes in passwords, they are likely to lock themselves out again. I understand this is largely an ""end-user"" issue, but it is a recurring issue at many sites. Perhaps lowering the threshold for the password would be helpful. A 4-digit pin is easier and more manageable for technicians than intricate password requirements (which inevitably are written down in a handy location so they can remember it thus defeating any security provided by an intricate password).  Streamlining the password / unlock request process. Is it necessary to have to contact support? Could this process not be automated using the technicians e-mail or other two factor authentication? This would eliminate the requirement to e-mail or call support. And theoretically (and I hate to sound like an MBA) but could cut costs for the service center or allow them to refocus their efforts to solving other issues.  Better access to associated PMs and WOs associated with assets and generated PM work orders. For me to look at the past PMs for a monthly generated work order, I have to go to the relevant WO, click on the equipment tab, click the equipment number, click on order history, then organize by date to find the older work orders. This is not intuitive, and with the limited access frontline supervisors and managers have to search, reports, and equipment detail, it is not feasible to search assets and draw relevant information, history, etc.  On-site supervisors and manager don't have adequate control over PM generation and Asset management meaning we have to submit asset changes to our SI7 manager to make relevant changes. This is time consuming and takes the control from the individuals with the knowledge need to be inserted and creating an unnecessary middle step to the process.  Last, if there was a way in which work orders could be generated real-time on a monitor, it could be incredibly helpful. For our sites that used used TMS CMMS system, when a work order was generated it would automatically print the order on the shop printer and we would immediately know that a WO had come in. It also gave us a physical copy to hand to technicians for them to read the relevant details, complete the assigned task, then enter the completion info into CMMS. A similar system, printed or perhaps displayed on a monitor in work areas would allow such real-time acknowledgment of entered orders. "
ServiceInsight,"Please add ""change problem code"" and ""change/set location"" to the mobile app. "
ServiceInsight,se podría tener una opción para cambiar de estado las WO PM en vez de cambiar de a una  por lo demás muy buena app
ServiceInsight,"Sit down with or do a teams meeting with a few users at our site and create, research and approve a few work orders to see how we use it and how it is not user friendly.  I will be glad to setup a few users on a teams meeting with you.  [Email]"
ServiceInsight,"it would be nice to receive ""training"" on the SI7 to better understand what all it has to offer. Everything I know on the SI7 app is what I learned by trial and error.  very little training was offered to me when I came back to CBRE almost 4 years ago.  We have had one training day on Teams with Ms. Frenetta Tate.  I, along with several others of my team, have had little class training time on this app.  I probably could be doing something in an easier fashion if I only knew the system better.  I typically use my phone app to complete most of my work on SI7.  I'm not comfortable or understand SI7 enough to"
ServiceInsight,"The IMFM format works better for entering work orders, but lacks the flexibility and control that SI7 has in the desktop format"
ServiceInsight,maybe add in some more problem code or equipment group categories to list
ServiceInsight,"I think the usability must be easier. SI7 presents some troubles when we change languages, for example."
ServiceInsight,"I think SI7 is outdated i.e. the layout, the colours, etc. I would be grateful if the 'change category' box can be eliminated from popping up every time a request is opened."
ServiceInsight,"I use SI7 for the majority of my CBRE work, as it gives me more flexibility and visibility on which vendors are actually being dispatched to. With the huge dispatch matrixes for all of the services, it's almost impossible to keep track of which does what and who is primary and secondary and tertiary and who has a tech to make ServiceInsight very useful.   "
ServiceInsight,"takes time to open and navigate through and WOs, assigning WOs need to be done individually which sometime it is time consuming need some flexibility especially in search tools, it is not user friendly when need to look for assets and PMs "
ServiceInsight,PM reporting could be better; missing the option to store building details at the building level with ease of access/reporting of those items
ServiceInsight,"Cost code selection is slow, and will erase input if done before the cost code has time to load - No Popup to show when session has become inactive - Login screen is unsecure (for me to 'log in' is to just delete the section of the url 'https://sso.mainstreamsasp.com/PRD00177CFG/log in' "" - After creating a WO, if creating a second one, and switching back to the first, the title will duplicate to the other one, and affect both (or all if more then 2). This causes confusion for the vendor.  If you want to see these issues, I can show you. Email: [email]."
ServiceInsight,A little vague on the meaning and purpose of this service 
ServiceInsight,"Lack of consistency with keeping conductivity. It Can lack user friendly features from time to time when it comes to communicating with other vendors attached to VAWS. It gives you an option to email outside attributes but doesn't always seem to deliver messages sent. There should be a more direct communication string that lets you see important messages sent back from the vendor or that you send to them that get directed to the recipient except through an email a message attached to the work order when it's closed. Also, the client needs to have a better understanding, at times, with what work gets sent to maintenance requests and other tasks outside of our scope "
ServiceInsight,I think if you had some training videos that will show us how to navigate through the site that would be perfect.  
ServiceInsight,"The report process is lengthy and after putting all the settings right, it still doesn't generate reports "
ServiceInsight,it would be great to get an app for the phone that works as good as the computer version. thanks Myron
ServiceInsight,"UI overhaul focus on lessening the amount of ""Clicks"" required to achieve an outcome."
ServiceInsight,"The tools is not friendly user.  It has archaic graphics, complicated search tool,  hard to find what we need.  Many times my team and I want to update a WO and we end asking for help in our organization because the tool does not provide the right access we need.    We are not allowed to integrate new PM schedules and always depend on others, but the response time is always more than a month.  Our productivity has depleted with this tool and the client prefer not to use it, since they never can't allocate their WO in the right field."
ServiceInsight,Be able to view a password when entered into the login page.  This would be huge and potentially cute down on password resets.
ServiceInsight,improve reporting
ServiceInsight,"Constantly getting kicked out of the mobile app makes things problematic, especially if someone else puts time on that work order. I have been locked out for weeks in the past because of this issue. The location being placed before the unit information is an issue. I think it should be, unit (by clients unit number), location, site, then bookkeeping or some whatever stuff. On the back end, we need the date in, date due, unit, who put the work order in, and the problem. The site information can come later. People usually know at what site they are working."
ServiceInsight,The preventive maintenance is not friendly. Also is needed in local language and with local job plans and frequencies.
ServiceInsight,"Systems take long to load or refresh . Often kick out , Hard to find the vendor or a category of jobs .   If you want to know what kind of tools could beat SI7 , look at Monday app . This is very user friendly and efficient "
ServiceInsight,"Small quality of life changes. Less of a need to constantly sync, and more streamlined menus in IMFM."
ServiceInsight,"When viewing the Quick List, regardless of how many WO lines a user applies in the system (I have it set to 75 lines), only 9 are visible, because of the fixed letter box style panel they are listed in. If this was expanded so that more were visible, making better use of the browser window available, WOs would be much easier to find when scrolling up and down the list.  WOs that have been closed have their status changed to ""posted"" after a period of time. It is not possible to link new WOs to posted WOs as related. This would be useful, as relating tickets builds a knowledge base over time."
ServiceInsight,Frequently experienced connectivity issues 
ServiceInsight,Very User Friendly program
ServiceInsight,"make it mandatory to have problem description along with problem location and other key details, before someone can submit a work order. make it have more steps to complete a work order so people who need the info get it an those who don't give enough will start correctly filling the request out "
ServiceInsight,A number of the processes require numerous steps to confirm an action and to clear the actions acknowledgment.  NTE uplift is totally illogical   These problems may be driven by user approval levels.
ServiceInsight,none
ServiceInsight,The system is not very intuitive. 
ServiceInsight,self generating work orders are over complicated being that you have to put your information in several times instead of a quick problem/ solution work order with labor time. Asset management isnt very user friendly for finding equipment or past work orders. 
ServiceInsight,Wish lists.  Site IDs on the work order would help. Not receiving a  email when I reassign a work order. It just fills my in box.
ServiceInsight,"SI could be improved with more functionality. If we didn't have Coupa and could do everything in SI, it would help. PO's are time consuming, price increase or decrease takes time. One stop shop would be so helpful."
ServiceInsight,None
ServiceInsight,Provide user friendly instruction/guide for information needed/how to fill out a req. 
ServiceInsight,Everything looks to be working out fine.
ServiceInsight,The only issue I have consistently is with login to the mobile app.  I usually have to try multiple times to login successfully. 
ServiceInsight,"Not for me, but for contractors I do business with. They need more help navigating the system/portal."
ServiceInsight,not at this time
ServiceInsight,"Integrate the NTE feature in SI with financial software, like JDE. Additionally, when a global vendor is added into SI in one country, the Global Strategic Sourcing team should ensure the vendor is populated in all applicable countries so that CBRE Clients can take advantage of this value add service model."
ServiceInsight,On the top of every page. If there could be a field in which you can type in a workorder number for quick search access. Sometimes im on the phone and have to type in the workorder number the client is telling me. Be say I have just done a site history search - now I have to find the drop down to get to workorder history and then type in the workorder number instead of just being able to search the workorder number from my original page. The home page/ opening page should also have this feature so I can dive into workorders as soon as i log in. 
ServiceInsight,It should be translated into different languages. I'm from the LATAM region and my native language is Spanish. I would prefer to use it in Spanish and so my team.
ServiceInsight,Printing reports does not always work for what I need
ServiceInsight,SI7 and Coupa need to be integrated. Once a WO is dispatched to a vendor the WO is basically useless and becomes a record. Running any kind of cost analysis report has to be done separately because you can't pull in labor (CBRE) and vendor labor/parts together.  Vendors resist and don't use VAWS. With Coupa it's not needed anyways. A PO is created right away not like JDE. 
ServiceInsight,Lag to run reports or Lag in general when entering work orders. Timing out of the system with no warning or notification
ServiceInsight,SI7 is used at a number of company sites globally - my understanding is we have a universal template that must work for all sites. This means the UI is not particularly intuitive as tasks that are operationally relevant to one site in e.g. India sit in the menu and may be raised by requestors in London - however the task is not relevant to London. Would be great to be able to tailor the UI 'per site' - as I'm sure around the world buildings have different offerings and vocab for tasks etc 
ServiceInsight,If the everyday repeated request can populate easily at the start of an entry that would simplify the process.
ServiceInsight,You may have a way of doing this that I don't know about. Let's say I have a pm ID for air fan. Well that ID for that all the air fans in the building are the same. I can't get SI7 to assign the af on one floor to one tech and assign another af to a different tech automaticly. I have to send all af to myself and then assign them to my techs. Waste a lot of time.
ServiceInsight,Fix some technical issues the work orders sometimes have and have a faster system.
ServiceInsight,I am kicked out of the system regularly when working for long periods of time.  Overall it is a good work order system.
ServiceInsight,It would be beneficial to be able to make copies of WOs.  Site number/location codes would be useful in the WO number.
ServiceInsight,"It is difficult to track work request.  It would be better with without the need for ""like"" or ""%""."
ServiceInsight,It shouldn't take 22 steps to create a work order.
ServiceInsight,1. PM library access to be restored since Jarvis access is still not available 2. vendor database: Multiple vendor record for same vendor creates confusion. Should be cleaned up. 3. JDE interconnection: more stable JDE data transfer to avoid delay in invoice processing
ServiceInsight,There are certain functions with the system that I wish were a little easier. 
ServiceInsight,I cant see what inside the request writing when I controlling my work section.
ServiceInsight,the options within the portal don't align with some of the requests needed here on site. i have to select drop downs that don't apply and then provide specific directions within the comments section. 
ServiceInsight,Sometimes the available options in the pull down menus don't line up well with the actual issue.  I'm not aware of a good way to filter requests only by my buildings.  The dashboard and the service history report show me every work order in the company.
ServiceInsight,"The only complaint I have is that I have to close orders on my mobile device, It would be so much easier to do all from desktop or if we have a windows based Ipad or notebook"
ServiceInsight,SI could be more user-friendly in part of asset database changes - bulk modifications etc
ServiceInsight,"Mobile aMFM:  This is the simplest tool to use, as it is more intuitive, but I don't like the following points: Very tricky to find the correct problem code. I keep typing in keywords until I find one that best suits my problem. I don't like the way of indicating nonconformities in building inspections. There are 3 stars and they indicate NA, No and Yes. I don't think it's functional.  Si Request: This tool inserted in the customer portal has a straightforward layout, but it is not easy to find the problem code either. Customers mostly open the wrong ticket, which causes the wrong priorities  Service insight portal: The site is not intuitive at all. I really don`t like to use it. To open a WO is very confusing and I don`t know one single person in my contract that uses it. Public export filters need some extra knowledge to use them. Quick list filters need to be exactly accurate with the data we want, otherwise, they won't appear"
ServiceInsight,"More focused needs to be placed on actually paying the vendors on time, and maybe shifting from the 90 day payment terms to a shorter timeframe. The payment process alone has been hurting our relationships with vendors. "
ServiceInsight,"It would help if there was more consistency with SI desktop, iMFM, and VAWS. The way you see the same data is so different between each application. "
ServiceInsight,As a new manager here at Cisco I am not up to date yet on all the processes used so I will need more time to make a sound judgement
ServiceInsight,"Some of the sub-categories are not obvious, such as ""other services"", etc. when trying to find the issue you're trying to address.  Meeting room set-up should be easy to find, etc."
ServiceInsight,I would like to see the due dates before I open the work orders.   
ServiceInsight,Service Insight could move a lot faster. It has a lot of glitches
ServiceInsight,"The tool is not practical, it is very inflexible and does not allow full visualization of work orders. Where information can be consulted, maybe I DON´T know to use it and exploit its potential."
ServiceInsight,"as a recording tool it does the job, I have the ability to use SI and imFM for the same service, it is unfortunate that they are not more similar in use. so, I only use the computer it is faster. I spend too much time on using it but it is required."
ServiceInsight,"I find the system, especially when coupled with Coupa/MyBuy to be very bulky and confusing.  I work with it since it's what we have, but would prefer something more streamlined."
ServiceInsight,"Service Insights is a necessary tool to use for properly doing my job. I do however find that there are a number of glitches that occur that can make things difficult. But overall, it is a helpful tool."
ServiceInsight,"Coming from using Corrigo this system is less efficient, slow, and lacks some of the tools other systems have. "
ServiceInsight,"1. Unable to use open SI on multiple accounts at the same time. eg: WAYMO and ANZ 2. There are instances when I cannot click on NTE request, not sure if the system will time out by itself. As a work around, I log out and log in, most cases, twice just to ensure the button works. "
ServiceInsight,Perhaps more access for techs. 
ServiceInsight,"We also use VAWS a part of the Service Insights suite.  The tool is useful because it is what we have. However, I have experienced some difficulties with the setup/configurations. For instance, the Set G/L-subledger.  Also, accessing some of the actions through tabs and others through grids.  A person could miss that all together.  I have submitted several enhancement requests and can't wait to hear the results. "
ServiceInsight,Make it more user friendly and have more info on the assets we have onsite. Give us the ability to add/change asset info. Make the call entry and compleation process easier and faster to complete. Make the app easier to use. Text our work phone when a new work order is made and when they are coming due. Create a bar code scan tool. Customize check list for PM and job steps. Have better unit info and ability to add asset to new work order for tracking. Have a real time help line for techs having trouble with SI7.
ServiceInsight,Not very robust nor intuitive interface. Personally I   would like ( among other things ) better print options so that one can print out task lists/ procedures etc into hardcopy instead of being fully limited to referring back to electronic device all the time.
ServiceInsight,Please look into a more user/vendor friendly system.  Going to multiple sites isn't very efficient.  This current SI system is cumbersome at best. 
ServiceInsight,"Serviceinsight provides really good service. However, sometimes the Si7 takes a long time to load on Job Steps.  And it won't be able to type on the next service list box until the last one has been autosaved. ( For the PM work order that I have, it has 80+ list inspection items, it will take a while) if the job step can provide the customer with a manual save/autosave option or upload faster, that will be wonderful.  Thanks"
ServiceInsight,a more modern interface
ServiceInsight,Not too sure what's ServiceInsight is. Was not introduce to the team.
ServiceInsight,"There are a good amount of general usability problems such as the ""View Service Request"" functionality and your ability to easily identify status changes/updates to your open work orders."
ServiceInsight,"Sometimes the platform as such has speed problems or integration with other platforms, for example: MyBuy, generation of emails or notifications, it is slow to load files"
ServiceInsight,"I think there are too many steps to rise a ticket. it is small things each of them but taking time in total. for example, need to click ""start"", type and select my name after login to the system and need to type the request and completion both. need to click a dispatch..  Daily basic request, we do not have something particular to type comments, so I hope I can rise a ticket without key board, just using only mouse is better then.  "
ServiceInsight,It could include parts listing
ServiceInsight,"Mobile app version can't be logged in and used. Desktop version is not user friendly, slow to load data and very difficult to use the filtering function."
ServiceInsight,"Sometimes when I sue the Chinese vision, The  WO completed time will in the future time.Not the input time.   And I want to create the PO from si7, if I use the Chinese description , sometimes will no PO create  in Mybuy."
ServiceInsight,Perfect
ServiceInsight,To be able to cancel or approve PO's
ServiceInsight,Improve the reporting system.
ServiceInsight,It will be a great help to save time when you have made an FCR wo and have entered documents so that they are transferred to the SUP wo/Po you make
ServiceInsight,After crush in april i have problem with Target time is ''Quick list new'' because the date is constantly changing...
ServiceInsight,make more user friendly
ServiceInsight,Entering a ticket thru the call entry with a timer feels very controlling and old fashioned.
ServiceInsight,No comments
ServiceInsight,I think I need some training sessions. It´s good to have a plan to introduce SI and improve its use.
ServiceInsight,"Seems like the program hasn't been updated since the 90's, it looks very old and not user-friendly"
ServiceInsight,Service Insight is a very outdated program which often crashes so you have to reload and is also very slow program. This is very frustrating and time consuming. 
ServiceInsight,Clearer method to retrieve WO's accidentally/incorrectly closed.
ServiceInsight,"The performance and speed leaves a lot to be desired - you wait MUCH too long between steps. besides, you don't need this confirmation pop-up at all. You need two clicks each time and accordingly more time for a confirmation that a work step is done. this extends the time for a WO additionally."
ServiceInsight,Many are times am not able to log in to SI 7 i keep getting messages to contact administrator to unlock my account. the downtime on SI 7 is also not good at all
ServiceInsight,"I find warnings every time a ticket is entered and I think it's a debug. often does not send the email to the requestor. to print a ticket you have to do 6 different steps, this is a big waste of time"
ServiceInsight,Frequent logouts from the program.
ServiceInsight,"SI7 is always extreme slowly even i use Edge, chrome, deleted cookie and etc. and SI7 has bad optimization for the web interface - i use 32 inches monitor and it shows just 10 row on one screen"
ServiceInsight,"In comparison to NVS's tool, SI7 is complicated, overpopulated with options (for office needs) and visually overcrowded. "
ServiceInsight,SI7 can be quite slow when raising a ticket. I would like if there were click buttons to acknowledge a ticket as opposed to going in to the menu to change the status. I work on Reception so I can get easily distracted with Visitors.
ServiceInsight,older version you were able to back date when completed... this system is more suited for a service company rather than in house facilties
ServiceInsight,"main issue is lagging of desktop site, every click can be a few seconds that all add up therefore less likely to usse it to full potential , also site and app logs out user too quickly so forever logging on, biometric log on in mobile app would be good "
ServiceInsight,"Do some research on the market and check how modern applications work. For example Singu FM or many, many others."
ServiceInsight,Cannot reassign to contractors with the mobile app. This would be very helpful
ServiceInsight,"It would be more practical if PA tickets were enabled through the mobile app as well. Currently there is no option to modify the type of ticket from SR to PA. The system level tree could be improved. If a ticket is opened on behalf of the client, they have no visibility on it. It would be beneficial to have key subcontractors on site have access and be able to open tickets like in the previous application (canteen, 3rd party maintenance, security, etc.). It would also add greatly to the usefulness if the platform was available in local language. Many of the manufacturing staff on my site does not speak English. It seems that the review function does not function properly. The customer receives the email, but when they click on the link it either says it has already been used or doesn't open the review platform.  It would be a more useful tool if the navigation/usage etc. was more practical."
ServiceInsight,"SIRequest bug reporting system not working. Even though we are supposed to launch it from July.   We have a test group at the client's. I receive information from the client that they can't submit a request or log in, I get login errors that we don't know what they mean. I've been getting a different error every time since last week and I can't complete the request every time. Below is a test login from this morning, I supposedly logged in, but I can't send the application"
ServiceInsight,There are a lot of restrictions in SI that make it a difficult program to self-serve in and to customize to improve the customer experience. Navigational functionality steps do not make the user experience efficient. I have a list if interested. 256-990-9087
ServiceInsight,I can be more interactive and user friendly. 
ServiceInsight,"The system could have local support, able to serve each market and training materials translated into several languages ​​for use by the managers of each contract, in addition, new users when registering do not automatically receive a password as already done in the past. thanks."
ServiceInsight,"It would be awesome if there was a field indicating whether or not the property is leased, owned or partially managed."
ServiceInsight,"We are in the middle of an active RFP that includes competitors like JLL and Cushman.  The feedback that we've received from our client is that ServiceInsight significantly lags the technology used by our competitors.  While I understand CBRE is investing heavily in Jarvis, I am not aware of any end users that are involved in the development process.  In the spirit of inclusivity I would like to see CBRE include service engineers and facility managers in the Jarvis development process.  Lastly I do not feel the CMMS Manager who reports to me receives an appropriate level of support from our ServiceInsight platform.  My primary concern is the manner in which ServiceInsight tickets are managed.  I would be happy to discuss this further with anyone who would be willing to hear that feedback."
ServiceInsight,"WE need to get more training to our customer on how to submit work order through Service Insight. I am showing a lot of customer how to use it. Plus the one that are submitting work orders, they are over the spectra and I spend time to correct them, so we a get a true count on issues we are working on."
ServiceInsight,"   sometimes it can get confusing, to many fields to fill out to open a work order."
ServiceInsight,I'd love to be able to attach multiple images at once instead of just one attachment at a time.
ServiceInsight,无
ServiceInsight,Improvement is required that we should able to see previous tickets.
ServiceInsight,Make it easier to attach attachments to a work order/request
ServiceInsight,Overall it is good to have because we can track the WOs which are requested from the Employees as well as can track the PMs for execution & closure on time.
ServiceInsight,Why fix it if it isn't broken 
ServiceInsight,1. The system needs to be able to be non 'helpdesk' capable. 2. the user interface is clunky and out dated 3. Global job plans should consider the technical legal standards in all countries - reference work by Kevin Hill's team. 4. ability to 'see' the asset list is too complex 5. inclusion of a 'statutory' flag for assets and PPM
ServiceInsight,SI7 needs to be more user friendly. It takes a lot of steps to get to where you need to go. If you can lessen the steps to say get to reports or PM'S to adjust it would be easier. 
ServiceInsight,"Overall Service Insight is user friendly and intuitive. My main complaint is the fact I have to refresh it every 5 minutes in order for the QuickList to stay active. Or, if I am working on something, exit and come back, it appears to be 'active' when the second you hit something it has to refresh. It would be better to just time out completely and return to the log in screen if it can't stay actively running, so at least you don't falsely believe your info is active and correct when it's not. "
ServiceInsight,incorporate the 360 into the applicatons to prompt a safety review before any work is completed.
ServiceInsight,"There are too many windows to get the basic information on a single workorder. We wish it could be all on one.  Clients complain that have to submit workorders that it is cumbersome. They don't always choose the correct workorder because they don't know where the correct selection is located, or they dont know what to select. If they choose the wrong selection it gets routed to the wrong person and we are unaware it has been submitted. And there it sits in cyber space.  Verbige is unclear for the client. A pop up window explaining the selection, or who it gets assigned too would be helpful. Being able to save a desktop layout in my workorders would be helpful. It always defaults to the original field layout when you go back into the desktop later.  "
ServiceInsight,"The passwords are a real problem.  There needs to be a clearer definition about what applications change when I am required to change passwords.  There is SI7, Service Tools, Imfm, Vantage, Sharepoint Site  & Microsoft Smartsheets that all interface with each other.  When the password is changed, it changes the password in some apps but not others.  It generally takes me 2 hours to change the passwords often times it ends up with a password reset because I locked myself out of at least one application."
ServiceInsight,"I'm a new employee.  Like anything else, the more I use it, the easier it gets.  It was confusing at first, and I sometimes still get confused, but I'm beginning to understand it better and hope to be able to take better advantage of what it offers."
ServiceInsight,"Sometimes I feel the tool is very good, but as a global account, not always all the options are needed in someplaces. It varies depend on what you have in your facilities and should be flexible."
ServiceInsight,Better signal strength & not so many logins per day
ServiceInsight,"it could be a little more specific for what we do.   Say, we have jail security network which includes card reader system as a sub system to the computerized access system.  And Si7 only have card reader system... "
ServiceInsight,It would be awesome if when creating a work order if it could be completed on one screen.  When I have to create a work order with a quote there are too many steps involved.  It seems that every time that you navigate from one screen to the next you have to wait.
ServiceInsight,"Many if you want to contact me directly [email]. Off the top of my head, on the WO screen when we bring up vendor details, they do not include the email. the WO emails that are send out are confusing. When using Site History, after looking at one WO you have to re-do the search again every time (not very functional)"
ServiceInsight,"An email reminder when a deadline is upcoming. I have long projects that are categorized as P-4, but they sometimes take months. A quick email reminder would be great.  "
ServiceInsight,The interface can use some improvement.  The design looks dated.  
ServiceInsight,ServiceInsight is very easy to use but sometimes the SI is very slow and takes to much time to create a work order
ServiceInsight,"Should have the facility to log incidents. Also, it is not that user friendly. "
ServiceInsight,It is very difficult to edit information regarding your own site. There is information on there that is over a decade old! It would be nice to be able to upgrade the the site as and when it's needed.
ServiceInsight,Sooooo many bugs..... Lag has improved lately... but it's generally still slow.
ServiceInsight,Nil
ServiceInsight,"Find a way to simplify the usage for the client. There are too many selections to choose from and therefor too many mistakes that can be made. If the client does not use it every day, it takes too long to find the correct selection/enter a work order which results in them reverting to sending us a mail and CBRE having to enter all the WO's. "
ServiceInsight,It freezes sometimes which makes creating work orders for clients harder. especially if we are in the middle of creating it and we'd have to re-do everything
ServiceInsight,"Firstly, nobody in management seems to realise what users are saying, SI7 is not fit for purpose!! Things have never worked properly & since the 'upgrade' 2.5 years ago it's been worse. Over half of our jobs disappeared after the change over to SI7. Our guy met with the SI7 rep for 2 days, went through all the problems & nothing was changed or done about them. Task cards are not correct for jobs. You can't add hours or edit after a jobs closed. You can't see other users times that have been booked to a job so can't tell if times overlap. You can't drag & drop jobs in the dashboard any more. Why did you waste time developing JARVIS when it's hardly used & the core basics aren'y running properly? Why is no-one in management willing to step up & get things fixed & working properly?   These are just some of the problems, but no-one listens to the boots on the ground when they're saying thing's need to be fixed for us to do our jobs properly!"
ServiceInsight,"The program is useful, but we continue with some improvement suggestions."
ServiceInsight,I am frequently disconnected even minutes after re-connecting. The problem occurs more often when using the Client laptop from their secure network. It happens less often on hotspot or personal wi-fi.
ServiceInsight,To open  a sub PM is too complicated. As well I face often issues by dispatching date of a work order. which is marked in the past and then too late to close properly the PM (wiht a smily green face for success) 
ServiceInsight,"The display boxes in the PM jobs screen, are just small enough to be maddening. There is room on the screen for larger boxes, so you can see all of the details in the PM job boxes that display the PM jobs without having to scroll a half inch, but this room isn't utilized. Also, when checking the Cycle Statuses in the PM jobs, only the work order(s) for one cycle show in the data results list below, even if more than one cycle ran for the time frame indicated - you have to use a drop down for the Cycle Instance field to see all of the cycles that ran during the time frame. It would be very helpful to see ALL work orders that ran during the time frame indicated/selected. "
ServiceInsight,Adding a receipt attachment to FPO created on MFM after the FPO is created be extremely helpful 
ServiceInsight,The system and the labels aren't necessarily intuitive for the user. The client approval process needs work as many budget holders are site-level rather than global and all work to a set PO issued to CBRE. The Vendor link to MyFinance and MyBuy will be interesting to see and explore.
ServiceInsight,"I'm still learning how to use the software, so I don't have much improvement comments other than the look and feel seems very outdated."
ServiceInsight,"Options for site, building/floor/area should be consistent throughout all locations for all ticket types. Ie: Male vs. Men's and Female vs. Women's. Both are within the same dropdown.   Would like to see Site or Grounds an option for ALL building/floor location options under each category.  Would like to see Locks (CBRE function, not Security), Konica (repair / ink replacement / paper), and Flooring Repair under Quick Requests  Correct spelling under Quick Requests for Food Service Requst (should be Request)  "
ServiceInsight,"I would like to be able to use SI7 as a financial tracking tool, but currently unable which makes inefficient use of my time. "
ServiceInsight,Response time and attention has improved in the last several months. That has been the greatest difficulty in the past. Appreciate the notable difference. Continued prompt response and troubleshooting will help improve team satisfaction.
ServiceInsight,its slow and reports are ridiculously difficult to pull correctly and with what you actually need
ServiceInsight,harder to find closed tickets if a need arises on an audit when you dont know a number of a ppm 
ServiceInsight,Why is it necessary to Complete a WO when my superior has approved the PO and I have received an email about that? Very old fashion in its appearance.
ServiceInsight,In general the software serves its purpose but the program has been down quite a bit during the time I have worked for CBRE. This year we had the issue with hacking or mal-ware...but there are frequently issues with MFM. It just seems like CBRE devotes great resources to systems that are less important to the daily work of our FM teams. The impression that most of my reports have is that CBRE doesnt care about the system at all and doesnt devote resources to making it better.
ServiceInsight,"At the moment, no"
ServiceInsight,"Having to completely delete an asset in order to edit, it is a waste of time, thus often I won't edit the equipment"
ServiceInsight,"I would love to be able to do all the functions from the IMFM, AMFM apps instead of having to use the computer. It would be nice to open WO's for vendors without having to open them and dispatching to me, then reassigning them to the vendor. If Service Insight and Site tools were integrated so that M/n and S/n would show on the WO it would be helpful especially if a tech was working in an unfamiliar location.  The ability to add time ahead of the actual date for vacation or holiday. This would be much more efficient so while we were on vacation we didn't have to interrupt our vacation time to make sure that our payroll time is accurate. "
ServiceInsight,"System crashes a lot. On the mobile device you have to constantly swipe the app away then re log onto the app to continue working. Another area for improvement would be easier ways to upload photos, also when completing a field po, if it would automatically auto fill the work order number it would keep from having to write down or remember the work order. There are a few other options that in my option would be easier to use overall I'm satisfied with how it is laid out and preforms."
ServiceInsight,Longer duration between login…frustrating you start a work order roll back 1/2 - 1 hour later on the mobile ap and you are staring over…waste of time & resources…
ServiceInsight,Needs a UX overhaul badly. This is not intuitive for a general employee NOT involved in facilities.  
ServiceInsight,Customized reporting and or dashboard module
ServiceInsight,"Mobile ServiceInsight needs to be more file and folder hierarchy. Dumping 120 workorders and only being able to navigate by target date, building site, or when the work order was produced is redundant. I use the tool ""building"" to look at all the work orders on that site but wish it would further breakdown to ""Fire LIfe Safety"" tabbing or highlight  in various colors to depict which work order needs attention first or have the ability to make those changes as a user. The limitations of the mobile app are as useful as looking at a click and look webpage. I would love it to be more interactive."
ServiceInsight,The mobile version is hard to use sometimes you put a work order in and it doesn't come thru  if you do a field PO it doesn't come thru you actually ave to close it out and relog in to see the field PO 
ServiceInsight,It would be great as I can find all reports in the work order directly.
ServiceInsight,"There are not enough specific problem reporting codes to drill down into, something that probably needs to be revisited.  Not enough training available to how to pull reports, to measure KPI's against the SLA.  The dispatching path somethings go through to many hands before being dispatched to the assignee. Job Safety templates is a lot and should be link to the problem code and automatic within the work order."
ServiceInsight,need to have better records retention and access to records
ServiceInsight,"wish we had some of the tools that were taken away given back, such as reopening a wo. we shouldn't be wasting time bothering our manager"
ServiceInsight,The system is often extremely slow when entering or pulling up existing information. It makes interactions w/clients longer and is frustrating when trying to access information.
ServiceInsight,Commodi impedit off
ServiceInsight,"Much of it is mainly for the property management division, engineers, maintenance, etc... I wish there was a version that's more for those of us that are strictly office management, where CBRE does not have the property management part too."
ServiceInsight,Seems like there should be a button we can click on to add the attachments.  VOS users do not always get the attachments. 
ServiceInsight,"Fix the issue with Quick List count [presently counting how many PO's issued and not just returning the WO count.]

Reduce the emails to sub-contractors. "
ServiceInsight,"many times, the feedback from client always delay two or three days to display in the system. I hope to speed up it."
ServiceInsight,I believe SI is comprehensive Work Management Tool.
ServiceInsight,"Non sono sicuro che le risposte che ho dato siano in linea con le domande, perché utilizzo SI per preparare WO che devono essere PO in JDE non per altri motivi."
ServiceInsight,"Biggest problem is two users can not be in the same work order at the same time. Second is that on the Unitedhealthcare network it thats sometime iit s slow and lags. A seperate system is needed for billing, like Coupa. One system for work orders and billing of work orders would be ideal."
ServiceInsight,NA
ServiceInsight,"Yes, if it is possible to allow expansion or hover on a field to see entire entry.

Shortcuts 
"
ServiceInsight,don't have useless information. Eg. the SCC box. its should never be checked so that invoices can get paid so why have it. Don't like the fact that if in CMP can't do anything. adds additional work. 
ServiceInsight,"At my place of employment, our company no longer supports Microsoft Office products and has transitioned to Google Workspace products. This presents challenges with utilizing the attachments feature (which we use a lot) within the Service Insight work orders. Most of the file formats we use are .xlsx, and they are pre-loaded into the PM work orders that are issued on a schedule. Whatever you can do to make the integration better between SI7 and Google would be greatly appreciated."
ServiceInsight,Asset and PM Module
ServiceInsight,"By giving more rights to the users.
- create itself recurring WO.
- Modify itself the informations of the suppliers (email address, phone number etc...)
"
ServiceInsight,Is there a way to speed up the perfomance of the system? It is slow to interact with and gives the impression of a few different programs trying to interconect with each other seemlessly behind the scenes slowing things down while we wait for those connections to happen. 
ServiceInsight,"SI7 is not user friendly. It looks old, outdated and is difficult to search for work orders. Also, we need a task calendar added to the system rather than just a dashboard. "
ServiceInsight,Make reports and searching easier to access and stop using the symbols =< >.  It is so difficult to get reports and nothing seems to download.  Stop changing accesses for users.  Make help more easily available. 
ServiceInsight,A more modern and streamlined system just to fasten the process and avoid missed kpis or inorrect details would be a huge help
ServiceInsight,Combine SI7 with Maximo.
ServiceInsight,reporting should be easier
ServiceInsight,"Even as an FM personnel, it is difficult to find the right category for requests. The search field doesn't always help, as some key words don't yield results. The grouping/categories should be more logical - even for laymen on side."
ServiceInsight,The notes function and the actual recorded history of the work order is confusing and folks often look in the wrong place! 
ServiceInsight,"Unfortunately, the Platform is very slow and loads slowly, looks like a 20-year-old website. "
ServiceInsight,"1) The ability to edit the description details of a work order. 
2) Having SR (service request) work types similar to what was used in Maximo to help with Root Cause Analysis reporting. Currently client requests come in as Corrective Maintenance which requires more work to filter out and identify client requests. 
"
ServiceInsight,"As the FM for a site, access to the PM planner should also be provided. -@ Standard reports should be more easy to find and generate -@ a module for tools and spare parts inventory should be available"
ServiceInsight,"Speed is awful, very slow.
System kicks me right out often and without any apparent reason, often while in the middle of creating a work order with a client.
Glitches where client's phone number won't stay in profile. 
"
ServiceInsight,Would love to have the ability to print out (PDF Version) of the work order and receive alerts from SI7 when vendor sends a message or submits photos/quotes.
ServiceInsight,Debería tener la opción de los idiomas 
ServiceInsight,PM planner need to be fix. It brings a valuable report for us to do budgeting exercise
ServiceInsight,"1- If work order assignments are to be sent to a single technician, they can be selected with a tick and sent collectively.
2- Why do we do ETA? Its not necessary...
3- We can not edit Assets, PM's, etc
4- We live login problem very often...
5- No Turkish Language so user does not open the ticket."
ServiceInsight,When submitting a ticket it would be nice to have the option to add the attachments right then and there instead of having to wait until after the fact. 
ServiceInsight,make it more intuitive
ServiceInsight,The SI request mobile app for various client users are not functioning properly after an upgrade. 
ServiceInsight,"Nothing, it is very detailed and helpful."
ServiceInsight,It would be great to adapt it more for each location. 
ServiceInsight,"The 'Jarvis' update impacted Si7 badly and it has never recovered. We are denied access to adjust PM scheduling, create a new PM or edit existing PM's. The reporting has also been badly impacted by the Jarvis update and is no longer fit for purpose as it now misses PM's when running reports. "
ServiceInsight,How can I easily search WO history? By vendor for example. Thanks.
ServiceInsight,I am missing the work reports attached in the closed workorder.
ServiceInsight,"I have a specific feedback about the SI7,

1. it's very slow, and takes time to load work orders or different information, which is super frustrating

2. The user interface is very old.
there are no FAQs or training available on the site."
ServiceInsight,"Improvement to how data is linked would be helpful Example. If you close a building in Level 2 of SI today, you have to manually go in and close all Floors and rooms. Same for updating the FM. That FM field should replicate to all Floor/Room levels. "
ServiceInsight,"Sometimes you have to search and figure out what category to assign to a request.
If possible, would it be possible to simplify the request, and have you list the teams needed within 1 ticket?  For example, the ability to select ""Porter Team"" for a meeting room set-up and ""Electrician"" to request power strips to be set for the same event?

It would also be nice if you didn't have to end the task, and then hit OK on the next screen to dispatch.  Once ""end task"" is selected, couldn't it do the dispatching without this additonal step?

Thank you and I appreciate your consideration.  
"
ServiceInsight,","
ServiceInsight,"Insight tends to kick the user out too soon (approx 10-15 minutes) whether actively using or not. Quite frustrating.

Jobs being locked because another user is looking at the file is also a frustration. "
ServiceInsight,I would like to see a skin that doesn't look like it's from the 1980s and it would be benificial to have more reporting tools and dashboards within it.
ServiceInsight,SI7 is not very intuitive and clunky to navigate and slow to load data
ServiceInsight,"It is very difficult to lookup old work orders for specific pieces of equipment.  There should be a list of equipmnet, and after selecting the piece of equipment it should give you the history of work orders for that.  "
ServiceInsight,"It's too ""clumsy"". It's slow loading all the open ( like 20 tickets). "
ServiceInsight,could use an overhaul and could be a lot more effective-pretty basic.
ServiceInsight,"Si7 slows considerably during peak times, when I use Si7 in the off hours I notice it is much faster to navigate. Thank you."
ServiceInsight,The frequencies of the PM ID's need to be adjusted ASAP! After 9 MONTHS this is still not done!!!
ServiceInsight,"Looking up previsous work order not easy.
Location are not all in alphabetical orde.
Many location are inncorrect 
User are not directly involue with updates"
ServiceInsight,Is it possible to share the report automatically on a weekly basis? where the team is required to take action.
ServiceInsight,"Almost every time when I Create A Completed Work Order and type the keyword in for the type of work I'm doing, the word search does not recognize it. I have to sign out and sign back in for it to work, it's annoying."
ServiceInsight,We really need a feedback system more intuitive and user-friendly. 
ServiceInsight,"it can be slow to respond , which becomes frustrating when completing quality checks, which is a repeat activity , also it would be nice if a  once a check has been completed it was flagged on the main search list so you don't have to write down each number and track progress 
"
ServiceInsight,Better training to use servceInsight 
ServiceInsight,A more user friendly interface would be ideal. 
ServiceInsight,"I believe it would be useful to have more team member involvement in organizing how we use the system and adding more detail so it provides a more robust history of assets, for use of the engineering team as well as management."
ServiceInsight,Being able to select/ select all to acknowledge work orders. Mainly when I get sent out 100+ work orders for the month. 
ServiceInsight,"one thing that would help me is, looking at my work orders for the day through the timecard option is a hassle, 
would be nice to have a simple way to see my time for the day in an easy function. "
ServiceInsight,"The mobile app is constantly logging you out, even when you have started a work order. There is more ""back office"" stuff displayed than useful information for the technician. Finding equipment or equipment history is very difficult. "
ServiceInsight,At times the system seems to be clunky or slow when using the system. Updates to PMs or work seem to not stick when updated and causes a lot of confusion with the admins and myself in duplicate work and updates to locations etc.
ServiceInsight,"It works ok, sometimes it crashes repeatedly or doesn't save selections."
ServiceInsight,An improvement opportunity- allow multiple unit entries in one labor window session
ServiceInsight, We recieve our work orders this way. All the team say its too complicated as in there is too much info tabs. Yes there usefully for say manager or supervisors. We just need a tab to open a job list then click on that and deal with what the job entails. It has been extremely slow recently.
ServiceInsight,Sometimes what need to request is not in the drop down but other than that its fine
ServiceInsight,have faster and more intuitive access
ServiceInsight,it would be nice if the app had its own distinct audio alert tone and push notification.
ServiceInsight,The requests should be read to assure the correct code is issued..
ServiceInsight,"I would like see the time intervals changed to 15 minutes.
If the tech can see how much time was logged in for the day, It would make service insight more precise. "
ServiceInsight,"Some jobs currently do not dispatch due to an ERP code.
The link between ServiceInsight and COUPA is not yet available making raising PO's more difficult than previous."
ServiceInsight,Entering work orders is very time consuming as some portions of the process are very slow.
ServiceInsight,functions from other work order systems are not present cannot put work on hold for parts or reschedules not much useful function at this time
ServiceInsight,"Honestly no since I understand the level of security that must be provided on accounts like this, multiple levels of verification have to be taken. It's easy for me,  but no so with a non computer literate person."
ServiceInsight,Field po creation process wo number should not be needed I'm in wo allredy
ServiceInsight,Very slow when you open multiple WO in parallel 
ServiceInsight,"AS a technician when I bring up the work request in the timecard many details of the work request are not carried over, I then have to go back to 1) My work orders, and 2) the email that was sent that I was assigned a work order. Very time consuming.
When entering a work order need the ability to enter the asset tag BEFORE saving the work order.
"
ServiceInsight,There should be a survey when the ticket gets closed out to rate the performance of the work.
ServiceInsight,"this is an old system, confusing and not easy to use at all, "
ServiceInsight,Not sure.
ServiceInsight,IT keeps kicking you out of the IMFM and you constantly have to sign a many times though out the day.  Say for example I want to see my pm work orders.  I have to scroll down to a building and click on a building's pms.   I click on a pm and then close it.  Now I have to go all the way back to the beginning of scrolling down to the building again and click on it to get my next pm for the same building.  Ugghhh. 
ServiceInsight,"There are just too many improvements to list needed for SI in this small box. 
* Database needs cleaned up and logically aligned to the field names on the front end UI
* ""buttons"" for adding labor, child tickets, etc. not inuitive
* asset management isn't even usable based on what is there now
* no reporting is used out of SI because it's ancient. All reporting done out of Vantage. 
* user records don't get updated because the entire process has gaps. (not to mention there's no data governance over security roles and users across regions in CBRE.  APAC SI teams can do what they want and don't communicate to other teams)
* ""Data loading"" is sub par. You don't even have auditing on who did what and when. 
* the whole inspection module is a joke. it's not at all relevant for any client at CBRE. You can't even customize it. We resort to using PMs for inspections. 
*Updating building information such as regions and details is so incredibly outdated and not logical. 
* Fields across the UI need updating and relevant to 2023 or industry standards
* it's hard to enter labor when your teams don't even understand how the screens work. Forget tracking POs when not all clients use MyBuy and yet accounts are forced to connect it. "
ServiceInsight,There is a field that our account can't use because it has been misused for another account. I don't think it's fair to us. We could use this specific field for its original use and it would benefit our efficientcy. Other point - The performance is sometimes VERY slow so efficientcy is not a thing then. 
ServiceInsight,"I would like to have training documents or partner with someone who provides training on SI7 - There is no one we can go to when we are not sure how to do something in the system, no internal support team. "
ServiceInsight,The system is not a one size fits all. Fairly useless in a leased site where the building has its own work order system versus an owned site which uses Service Insight exclusively. 
ServiceInsight,The mobile app needs improvements as its more difficult to use than the desktop version. It is much quicker to log tickets from the desktop.
ServiceInsight,"Open WOs in seperate tasks of browser (chrome, edge) will safe a lot of time. "
ServiceInsight,"Some parts of Service Insight can be inproved on,  but the questions you are asking are not the right questions.  Some parts of the app for moble can be improved on.  It makes working in the field/on sight and inputting information difficult and sometimes getting information difficult as well.  "
ServiceInsight,"For the majority of users SI7 is too clunky. For a system that is supposed to be widely used by site population, training should not be required.   There are too many drop downs menus (maintenance category) that ultimately mean little to the end user. For the most part, almost all of the requests at my sites go to the same people, so why do all of the selecting?  At my sites you select address and then the next selection is something like all rooms. Why have the category?  Thanks for reviewing my feedback."
ServiceInsight,We have difficulties with support in Brazil. It would be interesting to generate online training for local teams and have a contact in Brazil for system support.
ServiceInsight,The service desk computer is not set up like the PDA. Some of information is not in proper order. Once you figure it out it is not to bad
ServiceInsight,Service insight still has mobile issues. The only resolve is to restart my phone almost once a day
ServiceInsight,"The portal is not adapted to recurring tasks. We should be able to create recurring tasks by determining their recurrence, which would save time spent creating and closing weekly requests."
ServiceInsight,"The feedback/ survey email needs to be changed - I think, we should be creative to ask for feedback messages by changing the font and make it short and easy to read"
ServiceInsight,works well as far as I know.
ServiceInsight,Instead of primary secondary Tertiary for the vendors it would be nice to be able to have the name of the vendor displayed in a drop down or search menu. 
ServiceInsight,Could you make the amounts in the field po's editable in the slim chance that I make a mistake (instead of putting in negative numbers) just wondering. Thanks 
ServiceInsight,The ability to open multiple tabs. E.g. right click -> open WO in new tab
ServiceInsight,"I use this as our work order system. There are important things that are hidden in spots that you wouldn't look. For example, reporting vendor escort, training hours, admin time, meeting time and other types of time used for things other than work orders. Another thing is that we do not have a preferred vendor list that we can reference when looking for outside help. We do get a prepopulated suggestion, but chances are they are not the right one or we don't use them anymore. This issue costs CBRE more money than it should by being forced to use a company like Noontide who dispatch vendors at a very very high mark up in price. Companies like this take a $500.00 job and turn it into a $4000.00 to $6000.00 job. This is not an exaggeration on those prices. By not having access to a list of local vendors we can call for help, we have to call companies like Noontide or other National Accounts, which becomes a budget drainer. "
ServiceInsight,"It would be nice if it were simplified to ad correct information to equipment P.M's. On SI7. I'm the boots on the ground and I see ways that we can work more efficiently and easier. My jobs start for me on SI7 and we can do small changes that will increase our efficiency, time, and money."
ServiceInsight,reports are not helpful or intuitive per description. also crreated si requests is cumbersome. I find SI7 not to be very intuitive.
ServiceInsight,The requestor unable to input the priority levels in ServiceInsight. Most of the times the CBRE coordinator assign the request under P9 or P10. It takes more time to address the urgent issues.
ServiceInsight,"I would like to ne able to make more changes to my WO when needed. 
I recently had a wrong price at a cost wo and couldn't modify it. I had to cancel it and open another one "
ServiceInsight,"Just one Having to drag one PM or work order across the screen is time consuming. If you can  Select a group of PM's or work orders to drag across would be much more easy and less time consuming. I'm an engineer and every month I get lots of work orders and pm that are sent to me. If you guys can do that then i would be very satisfied thanks.
"
ServiceInsight,"I would like to be able to have more flexibility in SI7 with scheduling PM work, having the ability to send emails automatically for PMs by vendor, and the ability to autogenerate work orders from Site Tools and other programs. "
ServiceInsight,Would love to be able to print the tag/asset list to look at. Viewing from within Si is a challange.
ServiceInsight,There are a few glitches that take a little some to find work arounds
ServiceInsight,The system continuously times out throughout the day which requires a person to start the order over. 
ServiceInsight,The drop down menus could be expanded and better reflect each buildings floors/secure areas/stairwells/ etc.
ServiceInsight,There seems to be lagging data connectivity which slows down use
ServiceInsight,Some areas like the vendor dispatch and remit can get confusing.  
ServiceInsight,"Being a Senior Building Engineer, if would be helpful to be able to order/ purchase  
 parts/ materials through the work order system. "
ServiceInsight,Nothing to add.
ServiceInsight,"this program is not user friendly, there is too much clicking to perform simple tasks, tracking work orders is too hard, sometimes sort features work, sometimes they do not, it has actually become so time consuming to use the website I download my work orders in the morning and work from excel."
ServiceInsight,Very hard for me to categorize issue to what you have in the system. Sometime the issue cannot be found for me to input. Frustrating.
ServiceInsight,Bring the logout option back. Get rid of the drag a wo or pm from one person to another because team member have accidently reassigned a pm without knowing it. Better train our clients on how to categlorize wo because they only put general for everything. Then I try to recode it to no success. There's been occasions where something breaks and we need to fix it right away. I don't have time to create a wo before I start work. It would be nice to be able to create a wo after the work is completed without having to put it in a backdoor kind of way.
ServiceInsight,"Service Insight is the bases for our work order system so, I have to use it. Service insight is not intuitive, so I end up looking up work orders or researching.  I rarely use SI to open work orders directly so I use the customer portal or IMFM. Some CBRE applications are linked with SSO and some are not.  Since CBRE requires passwords to be changed every 90 days, it takes several hours to figure out which applications changed and which did not and end up locking myself out."
ServiceInsight,"lots of glitches, sometimes very slow. "
ServiceInsight,"Sometimes, it's an extra work for the site which only 1FTE. Managing work orders, submitting, and close will need extra hour and sometimes the work orders appear on the system are not required."
ServiceInsight,"I'm not a fan of the traffic light on the laptop. to me the laptop is too complicated!
Using the mobile APP is way easier for me."
ServiceInsight,"Service Insight needs more capability to view more than 8-10 rows at a time.  The constant need to export to Excel makes using this tool clumsy.  More interactive 'help' or 'hover' tools that explain the fields and columns.  Report generation's hierarchy is clumsy.  I should be able to populate 1 known field and then the rest auto populates.  Instead even if I know a site ID I can't progress without first finding the city.  Other CMMS or ERP systems do this seamlessly.
"
ServiceInsight,Improve on downtime 
ServiceInsight,ServiceInsight is too much complicated for small or very small sites.
ServiceInsight,"It's probably ignorance on my part, but it would be cool if I could see a history of what I've done on machines I work on, parts changed that date, added refrigerant this date...etc. 
  Being able to modify and add attachments to PMs would be nice too, instead of having to rewrite the same things repeatedly on lists that could already be populated along the way."
ServiceInsight,I use ServiceInsight mainly to close out work orders that have been assigned to me. I am getting used to using SI as I have been here just about a year. I would say I am fairly comfortable using SI and any problems that I encounter I reach out to my manager/colleagues. 
ServiceInsight,"Amfm is the worst app I have ever had the displeasure of using. It constantly freezes, logs me out, runs slowly and throws fault codes. I constantly have to clear the cache to perform basic functions. I have a long list of faults logged with IT. Get a functional app."
ServiceInsight,"Not at this time.  Currently, I just use ServiceInsight in a limited capacity when assigning technicians from FMO FXE work orders or reassigning them.  And looking up their contact information through it."
ServiceInsight,"When you have it open and have to leave and come back it log you off, some days it all the time and other it does not log off at all. Looking for consistence. "
ServiceInsight,"O atual Service Insight para a divisão da CIA, Kenvue e Johnson&Johnson, tem sido um problema constante com duplicação de WO's, falhas na transferência e dificuldade, visto que hoje no nosso campo de trabalho da Unidade da Kenvue SJC, utilizamos o CMMS Máximo, ferramenta homologada para Johnson e Kenvue!"
ServiceInsight,"I need more administrative control to revise or add assets, assign auto generations to specific technicians as needed, and make misc. changes as needed.

There needs to be quicker and easier paths to get WO history, view reports etc.

There needs to be better integration with SI7 and Coupa.."
ServiceInsight,not at the moment
ServiceInsight,"The date range is American, it would be helpful if this is English.
The system is quite slow and clunky to use.
There is a limit to the amount of attachments you can load onto the job.
The system logs you out in a short space of time.
It is not easy to download all of the job call logs in a meaningful format.
The customer only receives job closure notes and not updates on the job or attachments. "
ServiceInsight,No idea
ServiceInsight,"Just a little bit confusing the child WO, for the rest very easy to use and work with it."
ServiceInsight,I think a more intuitive and user friendly app/platform would help both technicians and tech coordinators work with this tool
ServiceInsight,"As CMMS tools go Service Insight is below average.  It is cumbersome to use and not very intuitive. I typically utilize support teams to help create the WOs and then I close them.  

I see that on other accounts we use Corrigo this is much better system with more functionality and support.  It has allows for asset management, payment tracking etc.  "
ServiceInsight,cheat sheet for clients on how to enter a work order and use the correct codes.  Educate vendors and clients on SI7 and have them add all pertinent documentation into the work order for a more streamline process 
ServiceInsight,Less Glitchy
ServiceInsight,"Allowing more active functions, like submitting field PO's, after starting a work order. Easier navigation and updating of labor hours and timesheet functions."
ServiceInsight,"It would be great if the FM could choose the priority and timing line of work order. FM knows best how long it can take, and sometimes it is very difficult to fit in the timeframe given and cannot be changed so easily. "
ServiceInsight,"FR:
laisser la possibilité de mettre un ""Problème code"", sans être obligé de choisir un existant, car ceux-ci sont incomplet, ex: Relamping inexistant dans la liste, Idem pour les lieux, ex: R+1 (OK) mais dans le sous-menu, existe uniquement sanitaire, alors comment créer une demande pour les Bureaux, couloir du R+1 ou Escalier? 

Quelques améliorations seraient utiles, ou bien lassé l'opportunité au Technicien de mettre lui-même les infos dont ils a besoin.

dans les onglets, ou les choix sont prédéterminés, afficher le menu déroulant, afin d'avoir la visibilité de tous les mots clés préenregistrés, afin de choisir le plus pertinent. 


une réel version FR serait appréciables, afin d'éviter les erreurs de Traduction."
ServiceInsight,If we get the trend chart for every month on the work orders we receive from the client and the PMs generated automatically would be helpful to project in the monthly report to the client.
ServiceInsight,"the interface is difficult and not intuitive, technicians can't see the maintenance plan on the first screen."
ServiceInsight,None.
ServiceInsight,Have better platform support 
ServiceInsight,"It is difficult to define parameters and run reports. For example, to find a certain PM for all locations or to find all corrective and project work orders (excluding PM's) for one location. "
ServiceInsight,Not able to see previous raised & closed tickets in the tool...Kindly improve to see all the tickets.
ServiceInsight,Make the Moble app more user friendly. You dealing with engineers that would rather fill out a paper form than SI7. Look at other apps like Hotsos or Tech Anywhere. Both systems are easy to use for the technician. I have engineer's that spend way too much time in-front of the computer filling out the JSA's that should be a simple yes or no multiple choice question. Hire the personnel that created those great easy to use systems and completely restructure SI7 with input from the techs in the field as appears to the personnel that sit at a desk pulling reports. You have made there jobs easy please make ours simpler!
ServiceInsight,"SI used to have the option to change completion target date if the WO could not be completed on time. It was very useful, should be back"
ServiceInsight,"I do struggle with the Problem Code. I work in a very large office, there are so many different things that goes wrong in the office and not many clear and precise code as to which to use. Sometimes it is a detailed issue like the numbering of the workstation/ desk is missing. In Si7 it will go under desk/furniture repairs. It is just a number that needs printing. There should be more sub-categories that is simple and relevant."
ServiceInsight,None to mention. Thanks 
ServiceInsight,"If you had some videos that showed how to use it, it would be better. I'm a new user and I'm having to self-teach."
ServiceInsight,Im Dissatisfied because we dont have all the assets of Coca-Cola in the system so is difficult to oversee if everything is doing right
ServiceInsight,"1) All WO's should be raised from a common screen. Now sub-orders of a Master WO are raised by accessing the Master WO eg E WO's. Whereas, C WO's are raised via the Call Entry page.
2) There should be an interface with MyBuy, so that when a WO is processed by MyBuy the purchase order number generated by MyBuy is written back to the SI7 WO. Also when an invoice is received in MyBuy or a major change for the WO occurs in MyBuy, the change is reflected on SI7.
3) Email notifications should be sent to the Caller &/or Assignee when the actual date is within a week of the Completion Date."
ServiceInsight,"For me on my desktop is working well, but for the CBRE technicians.  They experience many problems went the systems freezes a lot."
ServiceInsight,More user friendly interface and innovative look and feel
ServiceInsight,Sometimes the interaction is hard. Per example when it's needed to change the request and/or define some codes.
ServiceInsight,"Need full access in little menu in App for evolve the tickets. 
For be react to the client"
ServiceInsight,"Pour les clients :
Réduire la liste des sites pour trouver le concerné
Enregistrer les profils pour éviter à chaque fois de re sélectionner langue, site  etc.... 
Faciliter l'interface aujourd'hui trop lourde 
Difficulté pour le client de trouver les priorités adéquates 
Difficulté à trouver les thèmes : les réduire pour éviter les listes déroulantes

Mettre en lien le logiciel ServiceInsight avec les autres logiciels du groupe : Webquote et Coupa...

Globalement, par rapport au concurrent comme Eiffage, notre logiciel SI7 n'est pas intuitif.
L'équipe Sud Ouest Fedex a énormément d'idées d'améliorations.
N'hésitez pas à nous contacter pour que nous puissions vous aider à faire évoluer l'outil

Cordialement

"
ServiceInsight,Would be easie if sub orders were a link you could click on rather then having to search the number. Would make the process a lot easier.
ServiceInsight,When I ask for work orders to be reassigned they sometimes get reassigned to me instead of where I request it be reassigned too.
ServiceInsight,When it works its good. But many times the system won't sync correctly. 
ServiceInsight,you may perform more friendly commands 
ServiceInsight,A lot of outages occur
ServiceInsight,"Yes as a new starter i need training on this important tool ,is their a training g package for new starters to use. As it is the main maintenance system its vital its used to its full capacity . Please use me as a student as i need to lean it 100%  thanks for the chance to reply  "
ServiceInsight,"It's very slow, creating a ticket, searching for a work order, generating a report are tasks that are very time consuming, with either too many steps or loading times are higher than normal."
ServiceInsight,The portal goes down often and client cannot input service requests because of this.
ServiceInsight,More modern interface that allow you to identify things easier 
ServiceInsight,"It feels and looks clunky as well as a bit outdated, could do with a refresh with a richer graphically depiction. Also the allocation is very manual on this account, this should be automated to improve response times"
ServiceInsight,"ServiceInsight, It is a platform designed for maintenance.

The day this platform can be integrated into COUPA will be when it has an integrated supply chain model with more than one module and not only focused on maintenance."
ServiceInsight,I would like to request to have a live training for all users as a brush up training where we can ask any queries we are facing.
ServiceInsight,There are updates and functionalities that could be added. 
ServiceInsight,"Currently ,all the Service request can be view only on Desktop , in case Duty Engineer is on walk rounds or doing any activity and if any critical ticket is being raised , then he will not be notified on Realtime basis , No text message is being trigged."
ServiceInsight,Quite happy on how this system works
ServiceInsight,"Definitively we need the tool and it does much of our daily job.  

My feedback is that:

1. The tool needs a major upgrade with many and new modern features that graphics and colors that may please the user's eye.
2. The page looks too cluttered with too many options on a single page.  
3. People who spend a lot of time on this tool end up with visual fatigue, interest is lost and it does not make the user want to spend more time using the tool.
4. It is hard to make a search of a single WO and we end doing many steps to find a WO
5. My team is mostly on the field and less time on the desk computer.  They need a friendly user app to create WO, good catches and more important, the get notifications before the WO expires, whenever there is a new WO or a rush WO.  They all stop using the app, since for every instant they exit the app and seconds later return back to it, they have to log in again and again.  It should have face recognition or finger recognition. 
6. The tool minimize our productivity, since it needs a considerable amount of time for all; Example: more than 18 minutes to create a single WO.  We cannot create PM, this is manage by other, but waiting for others kills our productivity time.  The options to create a WO by its category is complicated to choose, not easy to classify and disorganized at the human eye
7.The client's portal is complicated too and my clients is now using other alternatives to the WO's since they cannot classify the categories well due to lack of common options
8. the graphics are hard to understand, they should be easy to understand at first view, but instead a deep interpretation is needed
The log in at the desk computer is now difficulty, since the computer does not memorize the password and we have to write down the password every time.
9. Whenever I download a report, the report does not record the assignee name if the assignee is one of my technician.  I simply don't know who completed the action."
ServiceInsight,"Make more user friendly, easier to access without constant resetting of credentials. Easier to update property and employee information.
Better choices for problem descriptions. More accurate priority code rankings. "
ServiceInsight,"With respect to problem codes, it would be useful if we had the option of identifying a request as 'capital'...often we are driving capital jobs from Si7 and the ability to pull reporting, especially for financial aspects would be very useful from an FM perspective. "
ServiceInsight,"My recommendation is that the service is not very friendly. Every day or every 2 days if you not login you have to reset the password, it`s really frustrated in this matter. It is not easy at all. I choose not to login every day. "
ServiceInsight,"In the labor hours pop-up, the ""Completed"" box should be a check box that can be unchecked.  Currently if you click the box, you have to close the window and reopen it to uncheck it.

Also, the ability to reassign a work order in the recode window would streamline that process.  Currently, it can only be dispatched to the primary building assignment from that window."
ServiceInsight,"There are so many different platforms that we have to use now - RAD, Harbour, elogbooks, , Si7. But none of them talk to each other! Si7 is ideally placed to be a one stop shop, i can't believe it is not already the case. When a ticket is assigned, in particular reactive tickets, at the very least we should have an option to complete a DRA specific to that task, that is now attached to that ticket.

Also, searching for a specific closed ticket is a nightmare, unless you actually know what that Si7 no. Is"
ServiceInsight,PM libraries and tasking need to be reviewed.  The tasking in SI Local is lost from the job step function and the titles are not aligned to Uniformat anymore. 
ServiceInsight,Can be difficult to navigate 
ServiceInsight,"It doesn't seem like we spend enough money on upgrading SI to ensure the best experience for our customers. Internally it is not even that important, but our customers shouldn't speak negatively about the way the interaction with the system is. The feedback we get from them is that the app is too cumbersome, the application experience is just not good enough from customer's standpoint. I know Jarvis is being piloted, but we are not moving fast enough with the upgrades that the system needs. In addition, we need to come up with an app that will allow us to collect and upload assets into SI without having to do it more than once. Asset Insight and capital planning tools should also be integrated better into SI."
ServiceInsight,Is need completion date request on the front side so we don't have to enter the wo to find out. Also it will kick you out in the middle of your work. Can you please fix? Thank you! 
ServiceInsight,"I would like to have more options available on the FM Dashboard, allowing me to view all the work orders that correspond to my role as an FM. At the very least, it would be beneficial to have the option for customization, enabling me to choose what I want to see."
ServiceInsight,No comments 
ServiceInsight,Search queries are complex.  There are a lot of steps which must be considered when pulling historical information.  
ServiceInsight,Mfm app would be great if you could upload more than one doc/pic at a time 
ServiceInsight,The search functionality is poor and the lack of a useable dashboard makes reviewing an finding information slow and onerous.  Have moved across to alternative BI platforms instead now
ServiceInsight,"Searching for assets is complicated, there doesn't seem to be a good way to search for assets at one particular site.  Likewise, searching  for work orders is difficult."
ServiceInsight,"Admin functions should be more intuitive.  For the users, more training should be available through platform seminars.  Our users are expecting more one on one training and do not find the links on the Intranet helpful.   Thank you!"
ServiceInsight,"the ability to assign work to groups and not individuals , this can be done as I have proved it with someone based in the USA , but as all things no notice is taken from those who have to use this pile of crap  "
ServiceInsight,UX could use some improvement. Too many clicks to complete tasks. Too many steps to create and manage PM jobs. Modern UI update severely needed. 
ServiceInsight,nothing I can think of at this time
ServiceInsight,.MFM needs a lot of work. It doesn't handle changing connectivity well. Times out and doesn't tell you. Doesn't allow multiple picture upload
ServiceInsight,"There are more steps than needed to get to the point of creating or closing a workorder. Setting up PM and specific equipment is not intuitive, time  consuming with all of the other task and training that is required. "
ServiceInsight,"There are too many work order status description ie; Completed, Work Verified Completed/Posted, Dispatched, Auto-dispatch, In Progress, Follow Up, Hold, Order closed, waiting paperwork and sometimes not easy to explain to client whenever they received our report.  "
ServiceInsight,I have ran into times when SI drops out and I have to re-log into the site. This seems to happen more than once in a while.
ServiceInsight,"If work orders are managed electronically, it's ok. But for those work orders (WO) that we need to print out (in paper) (Reports/Job Summary), the WO number and the WO creation date and time that appears in the first page, should appear in next pages of the same printed work order. In addition, date and time of when WO was printed should appear somewhere in the WO form. I hope these comments help. Thank you."
ServiceInsight,"There are processes and systems inside of SI that could use updating, just as an example, uploading multiple photos or files as an attachment to a work order at one time. "
ServiceInsight,Develop a more clear and user friendly interface
ServiceInsight,they should be need to introduce SI7 to client as most associates do not know if it exist. 
ServiceInsight,Dashboard tab is still under implementation and purpose is not served
ServiceInsight,For some WOs time zones are mapped with other region. Ex instead of IST its coming as EST.
ServiceInsight,the tool is not user friendly for client/end user. Many times they open tickets that have no sense because they are not able to use the tool.
ServiceInsight,"ServiceInsight is not user friendly at all. It is difficult to understand and we have received very poor training. What does ""Response target"" mean, for example? It must be possible to make this program much simpler, otherwise I just think it should go away. Everyone I have spoken to about ServiceInsight has complained about how time-consuming, difficult and unnecessary it is. "
ServiceInsight,"Lately there seems to be a lot of issues with ServiceInsight for my users. I've opened a few ServiceNow tickets to address but seems like thei work-arounds are to use SI7 in incognito mode which really shouldn't be a long-term solution. Additional the aMFM/iMFM app has been having A LOT of issues and I have users in EMEA using aMFM that cannot access the app at all. 

It would be super useful to see a list of all requested enhancements and be able as an entire user group to upvote/downvote enhancements that would be useful for all SI7 users, not just who has the best business case."
ServiceInsight,"Screens are slow to load, would be nice if they loaded faster. Also, the ability to easily 'next' through a dataset would be AMAZING. i.e., you select a list of values in QuickList or Serial Tag Maintenance. Once you click on the first record, you have to go back to the dataset to view the next record. Putting a 'forward' or 'reverse' button and allowing the next record to be viewed without having to go back to the dataset would save a TON of time!!!! Lastly, having a developer dashboard/page where users and admins could up vote / down vote enhancement requests would be awesome!!"
ServiceInsight,"It is an ancient program. it needs to be updated, It seems like I am using Windows 98"
ServiceInsight,When it comes to SI I don't feel like we use it to its fullest capacity.  I believe there could be better reports and better access provided to the client for visibility into what is going on with their sites.  Some of the options (like trying to find a report)  look complicated and could be streamlined for a better user experience.  
ServiceInsight,"If we get hands device access it'll be helpful to upload the issue real time in the SI7 portal and also if we implement QR code system we can save the time instead of filling the application just in the scan we can get the all the details ( Site name , floor, location ext)"
ServiceInsight,Better UI. More options user-friendly menus. 
ServiceInsight,The client does not use the tool to create SR. They use email or they just approach us and tell us what they need.
ServiceInsight,The interface could be much more intuitive.
ServiceInsight,Our client (Coca Cola) is not very helpful with the uploaded of tickets
ServiceInsight,"
very little intuitive software, too complicated to create WO."
ServiceInsight,"Interface
Jobstep (in AMFM)
Meters energies
Sparepart managment
Printable PM WO with all information in one document."
ServiceInsight,The systems works great!
ServiceInsight,"The whole platform needs an update like more Modern CMMS used by CBRE including FM Pilot, IFM."
ServiceInsight,Required Mobile access as well so we can easily raise a tickets in tools and need some user friendly as well
ServiceInsight,"I feel some of the extra screens and the way service requests are processed are unnecessary and could be ""cleaned up"". Feels a bit sloppy.  Also, would like to see a better listing of locations noted at the various spots. "
ServiceInsight,Being able to edit your issues and not have to put in Water bottle: then the issue. Make an area that you can put in the issue. 
ServiceInsight,"I asked for additional sites to be added to my contract, they are added but duplicated and do not pull a bud reference from My Finance this has been going on for 4 months trying to sort the issue out but to no avail, so I have to raise the sites work orders onto the main office of the contract which is not helpful. "
ServiceInsight,"You can increase the font size.
You could allow the tickets to be marked at the list, with colors or flags.
You could send a reminder two days left until a ticket expires.
You should tag the ''Furniture change'' like a facilities work, maybe ''general maintance''."
ServiceInsight,"Especificamente en la aplicación móvil es algo complicado agregar el código del sitio. Sería mucho mejor poder elegir, pais, ciudad y edificio.
En el uso de la plataforma en laptop a mi no me gusta que modifico los tamaños y orden de las columnas pero en el momento que se actualiza la pagina, se regresa al default.
Otra cosa molesta es que no se pueden abrir los tickets en una pestaña nueva para conservar el listado en una y los tickets abiertos en otras.
Tambien sería útil poder pintar con colores o etiquetas los tickets que estamos administrando.
"
ServiceInsight,"•	The quick list view should have the ability to display more than just 10 rows at a time. It is challenging to keep sifting through when there are several hundred work orders to manage.  •	The FM PM Jobs view is also difficult to follow where you can only view 9 at a time and it isn't in a list but rather in tile format. I also can't truly tell what PM I'm looking at in this format as it just displays this: D3041.01.02-A-CBRE-Global-EN – 100889. I can't tell what asset I'm managing by looking at this.  •	The PM creation process is overly complicated. There should be a guided process that allows you to create an asset for the site, create the job steps needed, define who it should be assigned to, define frequency and everything else required in a centralized, easier guided format. "
ServiceInsight,Only that it needs a simpler format.
ServiceInsight,The only issue I have with Service Insight is that not enough Vendors are using the VAWS portal to update their WO's. If they would do that then the system works well.
ServiceInsight,I can do the basics but would love to see training videos that I can reference back to when I need help.
ServiceInsight,"Running reports could be made easier.
Further infrastructure changes or additions would benefit SI. If you could link specifically to buildings or equipment would be beneficial."
ServiceInsight,The system sometimes locks in PRL status for an extended period of time and an administrator has to unlock the affected WO. This causes a delay in the flow of work and assignments
ServiceInsight,I would like to see the priority P1-P6 in the IMFM phone app 
ServiceInsight,ServiceInsight is a cumbersome system for all involved.
ServiceInsight,1. Service Insight Password need to sync with CBRE as currently CBRE logon has diff pwd than SI7 2. It Would be nice if system can send reminder email for any SR that are due to expire so we can close or extend in time . 
ServiceInsight,I would like to hope change so that multiple people can receive request receipt notifications via email.
ServiceInsight,"Buenas tardes  Como sugerencia,  Mas intuitiva  a la hora de cerrar una wo/ticket. Sin mas Quedo a disposición ante cualquier consulta. ¡¡¡Saludos!!! "
ServiceInsight,the tool doesnt work as fast as it should 
ServiceInsight,"The site is too slow, closes all the time and too many clicks just for one option.  There should also be a readable dashboard for work orders.  Too many steps to close "
ServiceInsight,"Being able to access submitted tickets and their details in an easier manner would be great. Eliminating, or unchecking, the cost button would eliminate extra steps when submitting tickets. All in all, it's still a very easy process. "
ServiceInsight,"Connectivity issues need to be address, being chucked out of SI when trying to work is extremely annoying and unhelpful."
ServiceInsight,"Service Insight as a whole is very clunky to use.  One of my main complaints is the inability to use the Data Loader for more things...the system works more of a one by one method better sometimes through the main screens than it does being able to use the Data Loader.  
creating things like schedules...4 separate process..it feels like it take forever to do things especially if you have to create any part of those from new.  Overall I find it to be slow and clunky. "
ServiceInsight,It is very time consuming to create pm jobs
ServiceInsight,"This seems like an outdated CMMS, I do not like the fact that I cannot create my own reports. "
ServiceInsight,"I would like the ability to run my own reports, the navigations are somewhat clunky. It is a slow system."
ServiceInsight,"it is a quite complex tool, I have to admit the interface and overall look of the tool is not very pleasant, however the tool is useful in general. I am still learning it. "
ServiceInsight,When making a migration plan ahead and ensure all vendors will be able to have access.
ServiceInsight,"Phone number on home/login page for support.  Currently there is only an email, nothing for instant support."
ServiceInsight,"Scheduling confirmations, arrival dates etc is ridiculous. Past and future dates make it a miserable experience"
ServiceInsight,I only use the Vendor Activity Site.  I am not sure why we have to use it.  All I do is close out work orders.  we do nothing else in there.
ServiceInsight,"It takes days to get NTE's raised, and days to get work verifications done. No easy way to communicate with anyone. There should be a phone number to call for help."
ServiceInsight,As a CBRE employee I want to be able to easily view by day/week/month closed work orders from an easy selection menu. It is too difficult to view anything once that w/o gets closed. A spreadsheet with the closed w/o based on the search criteria as stated above. 
ServiceInsight,"The interface looks very much like windows 3.1 and outdated. It's not very ""pedagogical"" or intuitive. It would also speed up things if the various other tools we are using would be connected - Mybuy, NCSM together with SI now all require more manual work rather than less and it's not clear to me that whatever we input as much as we try does in fact clearly reflect reality. "
ServiceInsight,The automations and integrations being made through SI7 and Jarvis project are very helpful for the end users. Makes completing changes in SI7 user friendly. 
ServiceInsight,Since you cannot charge time on a work order before it was created but you can create a completed work order on the mobile app it would be nice to have it on PC application as well.
ServiceInsight,"A transfer from Maximo to SI_7 was a rushed experience, asset descriptions have become ambiguous. Quite a few issues to be honest. The quick links is not user friendly amongst other problems. The software overall is very dated and requires time to navigate. "
ServiceInsight,"When you are submitting information into Si7, it's a very easy software to use. My job requires me to follow-up as well review data inputted in Si7, and it's easier for me to export data into excel and review it that way. Therefore, for day to day data-entry, very easy to use. For maintenance of records, it's easier to review data with Excel. For support to Management, if you want to review the progress of work orders being resolved (or invoiced), answer vendor payment follow-ups, the easiest way to do so is through a combination of data exported from Si7 into excel sheets (encrypted with passwords for security). I am available to demonstrate on my screen if you're interested. "
ServiceInsight,"Too slow, can't multi task especially when opening multiple work orders. Hope this will be improved on the future update. Thank you"
ServiceInsight,Users commented that the system hang and not user friendly
ServiceInsight,It is a complicated system and it is difficult for the customer to create a ticket. The customer prefers to email all notifications rather than put them into the system through a roundabout way.
ServiceInsight,"Is better to improve the setting and procedure in ""Job Step"", ""Employee Maintenance"" & ""Maintenance Frequency"". which are not easy to use and response and close the task. "
ServiceInsight,Jarvis number R which then pulls the true R number that ISS work from is confusing. System sometimes crashes without any update from CBRE 
ServiceInsight,none as of the moment
ServiceInsight,nc
ServiceInsight,"It would be nice to be able to ctrl+click or wheel-click to be able to open work orders in a new tab from the dashboard.

It would also be helpful if I was able to change my time zone.

To be able to print a work order without first downloading as a .PDF would be great."
ServiceInsight,"We should be able to correct labor or notes, can not do so once its been entered. "
ServiceInsight,The new login process has been a disaster for our teams and is causing major issues for everyone involved. 
ServiceInsight,"Dispatch can be a bit glitchy sometime. I've raised several PI's which were not dispatched on time due to continuous loading, despite page refresh and clearing of data - this can be a risk to KPI targets. Overall its a good program to use and helps us track our client demand and work load easily "
ServiceInsight,"For visibility, my answer to the first question is all 3: I put in tickets, respond to tickets, and manage my teams and my vendor's tickets.
I do not know what improvements to suggest, as this is the only Ticket System I have ever used. Most complaints I receive from my team is that duplicate tickets are put in, and that people do not put in correct locations. "
ServiceInsight,"The tool is not user frindly. It is difficult to navigate. I cannot find assets, PMP schedules.
The tree of problme codes is not logical."
ServiceInsight,"Actually ask some questions which are relevant to engineers.

It would be nice if the mfm app had an option to search for R number of a job not just BU number.

Also equipment tag button should be greyed out once equipment tagged

Steps dynamic risk assessment option should be easier to use and clearer.

Option to order jobs by response date not just completion date"
ServiceInsight,"The naming conventions are sometimes difficult.
Also, would be beneficial that as a user who logs in if only my buildings were listed on any drop downs. I work for health, so unless I am a tenant in a building, I wouldn't need to see a Min of Transportation site or a courthouse."
ServiceInsight,"From a technician perspective, if certain aspects of the programming have difficulty communicating with each other, clear up those issue. Example, we are told that from iMFM, if we action a work order by skipping a step, it has trouble communicating that back to SI7. Say I open a work order and skip the acknowledgment step, and go right to start work, it apparently has behind the scene consequences. If the program was built to only allow certain actions at certain times, you could potentially eliminate the user error. Example would be, I can not action start job, until acknowledgment has been completed, I can not close a work order until questions/check boxes have been checked, like did you purchase materials, did you attach receipt etc.,make it technician proof."
ServiceInsight,"The interface of the platform is not good, the reports are very restricted"
ServiceInsight,Had trouble using when I was first introduced to Service Insight. As time progressed I started to understand and get familiar with the system.
ServiceInsight,Change mobile app back so I can create and assign work orders to FM's or managers. I can only create and assign to my self then have to reassign to employee. I do not assign to vendors.
ServiceInsight,"Unfortunately, our clients do not enter orders into this program. We have to enter orders manually ourselves. Probably it is needed to adapt the program to our clients."
ServiceInsight,"No, I don't have any comments!
Just want to mention, that app for mobile crashes quite often and it is so annoyng."
ServiceInsight,"Dear Team, 

Thanks for seeking the feedback:
1. User interface needs to be improved for ease of access/ more user-friendly.
2. Network Speed tends to be slow. This is a major setback.
3. Process can be simpllified (like too many prompts or mandatory checks to be cleared, before proceeding further).

Thank you very much.
Regards,
Pramod Kumar K."
ServiceInsight,"With the implementation of Supplier Shield there have been a ton of issues with Service insight. Rejecting tickets without proper explanation, vendors not flowing from JDE to SI7 and we have to submit a ticket for every new vendor and then it is being rejected. "
ServiceInsight,"The tech should attach receipts and I am not sure where to find them.  I see attachments but sometimes they are pictures.  When I try to see if a PO is keyin/keyout or keycap, not very user friendly on how to find information that I am looking for and sometimes after so many years it is not shown and for reporting sometimes we have to look up things for years before."
ServiceInsight,"Report scheduler not working. Submit ticket for over a month, the issue still appears."
ServiceInsight,"Work history performed by previous technician  on particular asset 
IMFM when using asset list for whole job site, if you have a particular asset pulled up you click the back button and it makes you have to start over and enter the site ID again"
ServiceInsight,"Somewhat easier in use. Especially for the client.
Communication about changes can be a little bit better.
"
ServiceInsight,"For the client I work for, the SI Request is not user friendly. They suggested using QR to read in each room. They want something really fast and simple to work on.
As a facilities coordinator, I suggest a complete trainning about the ServiceInsight, including how we can make the configurations, how to add rooms, delegate the work ordens, etc, to better meet the client's needs.
I found on the intranet some documents and manuals about the ServiceInsight, but I was not sure how up to date it was.
It also would be helpful to have some material in Portuguese (Brazil), a point of contact to be the reference about ServiceInsight and the best practices used in other clients.
I would love to help  improving this product with CBRE."
ServiceInsight,"when transferring jobs from dashboard to technicians, you cannot move more than one across, when there is a number of activities, say 30 plus it takes what seems like forever  to move them all across, especially if that technician is at the end of the page and what for the screen to catch up. multi-moving or having peoples names as a side bars to transfer takes would be ideal."
ServiceInsight,This app crashes often. 
ServiceInsight,Using a tool that was clearly made for alternative means such as a call center and not updating it to be useful to the current FM division shows a lack of interest. The app is incredibly glitch and has a dated UI aesthetic. A massive overhaul of just a brand new not internal system would be needed to be actually helpful. Or simply allow people who actually do the daily ops to use the tools provided by the client 
ServiceInsight,"The ServiceInsight that I use is slow to download. 
We use it for workplace experience, meeting and events team.  "
ServiceInsight,Needs updating.
ServiceInsight,"The online system is extremely slow to use. Also, I am constantly resetting my user settings or views because the system doesn't always save and display them. The CAT5 process where emails should get sent to customer for approval doesn't work, ever. Many times I have had to ask an administrator to unlock PM work orders preassigned to a tech or vendor, so I can reassign them. Worksite users consistently complain they cannot access or log into the customer access portal. "
ServiceInsight,n/a
ServiceInsight,handling should be easy like FMP
ServiceInsight,Esta plataforma debería enlazar información con otros programas  
ServiceInsight,Sharing pictures is difficult.
ServiceInsight,"It is extremely hard to use, it is slow, crashes all the time. Unfortunately, it is just a pain to use the ServiceInsight."
ServiceInsight,The Display Log History box is to way to small. I would like to see more of the dialog when scolling through. I would be nice if it was double the size if possible or bigger. Thank you.
ServiceInsight,"I primarily work with BB PPM related orders and occasionally create them as required. Perhaps allow 100 work orders to a page, 7 just doesn't make for the investment involved in using the software."
ServiceInsight,Could be leaner.  Less steps.  Less clicks.  More on one screen.
ServiceInsight,My training was months before I actually had access which meant I'd forgotten half of what I learned. Please make sure the trainings are closer to when we actually have access to these tools.
ServiceInsight,no..
ServiceInsight,Easy access and useful
ServiceInsight,From app to call in center the system is shot and requires so much work it needs to be redone from top down.  This another one of those things where leadership matters. Now I know we have a new team and new leadership so that's something.  But at the end of the day I don't know if there's much worth saving?
ServiceInsight,"I think it could be simplified, there are so many menus and I have never been trained on what they are for.
I sometimes find it difficult to find the correct option in the categories, when raising a ticket.
I would also love to have a SI7 manual as a reference point for unusual queries. "
ServiceInsight,There are too many functions in SerivceInsight that seems irrelevant for working with Work Orders.
ServiceInsight,it would be nice to have emojis to use. and better word processing
ServiceInsight,"I prefer to have this system more user friendly so any technician/supervisor can use it easily.
If there is a mobile app as well will make things move faster"
ServiceInsight,"In the dashboard at Indianapolis, IN the headers are people's names not their service function.  It would be better to list their service function also so we know where to look for it if needed when reassigned to another service function."
ServiceInsight,Need info that is important to be visible easier than the info not as important on the mobile version and desktop.  Digging around to get the basic info gets to be a hassle and the system wants to sign you out all the time.  
ServiceInsight,it is very usefull
ServiceInsight,"The same supplier has different information, and users cannot modify the incorrect parts"
ServiceInsight,"Not so much improve SI7, just looking forward to the day we can link the finance system with it in the UK."
ServiceInsight,More user friendly
ServiceInsight,"My comment on SI7 2 years ago was to have one sign on for the CBRE system, and CBRE has completed the task. Thank You "
ServiceInsight,"It would be great if ""Problem Description"" can display the full information. "
ServiceInsight,The reporting is not good and access of the data is not readily available
ServiceInsight,"It needs to be modenised with the times, the source code in the inspect element shows there is code being used that was deprecated 10 years ago. It needs to be faster, made more intuitive, interface made less complex, some basic CSS adjustments to make it cleaner and less ugly. "
ServiceInsight,The UI is not user friendly and is not easily configurable. Reporting is extremely limited for all users which leads to additional administrative requirements from the CBRE team. There are consistent system issues creating inconsistencies in work order management with the entire platform having an overall lack of support when issues are noted.  End users such as vendors (VAWS portal) have little flexibility and poor reporting available to manage high volumes of work. 
ServiceInsight,"Si is very easy to use when you know where to find it, but at times can be difficult to find tools that would make daily tasks easier."
ServiceInsight,"Hello maybe put it in french as well for the users based at Novartis Pharma Paris 

thank you"
ServiceInsight,In regards to the mfm app that I use on a daily basis for the work I do. I do not see anything outstanding about the app and it has some minor faults and could be more user friendly. It gets the job done though so nothing I can complain about.
ServiceInsight,UX can be improved for a cleaner look to navigate options. SI still lags and takes awhile to load datas but workable.
ServiceInsight,A lot of people from client have problem whit on logging. 
ServiceInsight,You could put the DRA  questions on Insight at the start of each job like SI Tech for other contracts before you can start each job
ServiceInsight,Share manuals 
ServiceInsight,"Not available in local languages
We can not see the client portal so we can not help them directly to solve any application related issue"
ServiceInsight,"I whish the system would not log you our out of the no where, sometimes I am working and the system logs me out and it has nothing to do with inactivity. it just does.  "
ServiceInsight,It is a bit rigid to use!
ServiceInsight,Occasionally experience long loading times and technical issues such as being logged out repeatedly while using
ServiceInsight,No 
ServiceInsight,Sorry but I am not using this software at this time.
ServiceInsight,"The response times when loading a requested page are sometimes very long, several minutes. If there is an improvement, this would be very helpful."
ServiceInsight,"Yes, I have lots of comments, and you may not like them. When I joined CBRE on the Yahoo account, they were using something called Intrepid. It was garbage and they upgraded to SI7, which I help beta test for the account. It's not much better. Facts, SI7 is at least a decade behind industry needs and requirements. The mobile app has never worked. Asset Management is adequate. The CM and PM ticketing is cumbersome. It is very difficult to create a weekly PM schedule. There is NO material management or inventory control ability. Condition assesment is barely there. Bottom line is, I should be able to issue my tech a PM work order, a warehouse, or tool stores person, recieves the same order, kits all the pieces and parts for the PM and the tech picks it up, goes off to the roof and performs the PM, none of this, I forgot a filter or a belt. Maximum efficiency of wrench time needs to be applied here. Also the tech should be able to input the condition of the equipment his is working on. Identify any issues he finds that need to have a corrective work order, create said work order on the spot, and the both are connected as parent and child. SI7, does have a parent/child relationship, but the tech has to do all of this at his desk top. People forget things, photos don't get attached etc. Before I came to CBRE I was working at a national labratory in Livermore CA. We were using Maximo in connection with Tririga. Out of the box the system did almost everything we needed. That was in 2012, when I left. Here we are in 2024, and SI7 isn't even close to what we need in the industry. My suggestion to you is to take a hard look at what is working out there. AND, if CBRE is so insistant on keeping SI7, because we own it. Then you need to move it in the direction where it is competitve and compariable with what is on the market. Right now, CBRE is failing to provide my techs with an adequate CMMS tool in order to perform their jobs and help meet our KPI's. "
ServiceInsight,"Serch function does not work properly, FM's need access to edit assets on the fly.  Need to be able to wrap problem description."
ServiceInsight,"Jarvis is a good improvement to SI, especially the ability to put all PM Equipment frequencies on one page."
ServiceInsight,"It would be great if we could run queries to see work orders by building, rather than having to know the work order number and look up each individual work order."
ServiceInsight,The flow of adding photos during close out of tickets a little backward and out of place on form.  Closing out ticket fields should be combined(auto) or have the ability to be adjusted for efficiency since it seems a little redundant.
ServiceInsight,Clearer dashboard would be nice
ServiceInsight,easier steps to navigate throughout the work order
ServiceInsight,"As a supervisor whose technicians are mobile and look after various sites one thing which would be useful to me would be able to change the primary, secondary and tertiary contacts for different sites. Currently I would have to contact my office tea and wait a long time (months) for this to happen."
ServiceInsight,I wish it were more user friendly and it was easier to access reports.  It would be nice if we could set defaults for the perimeters to run the reports for the engineers hours or know how to do it if it's an option.
ServiceInsight,"The only thing that I think needs improving is the speed of downloading the reports, and trying to not time out when working on the portal, other than that I think it is fine."
ServiceInsight,Make it more user friendly for contract supports 
ServiceInsight,System seems to have a lot of bugs. I have work orders that are marked late but I cannot access them. they are restricted. It's like it has a memory leak and there are other random issues that pop up from time to time. hard to remember what they are. It would be a great improvement to fix those first.
ServiceInsight,"If we could have an e-mail address that would feed into Service Insight and create a ticket. So, the user would have 2 options. One go into the portal and create a ticket. The other send an e-mail that would convert the request into a ticket. "
ServiceInsight,Actually my dismay is with IMFM. It has continued issues.
ServiceInsight,Need to be adjusted per site and units or equipment's. A lots of procedures are not applied for the equipment's. Others are too poor.  Site Supervisors need privilege's to delete or add inspections. I think is the best way.
ServiceInsight,My level of security does not allow for the correct information to be updated for assets or work tasks
ServiceInsight,"It is a complicated system seams to old school for me, it is not intuitive at all."
ServiceInsight,"I think if the ServiceInsight UX is more intuitive, then it would be much easier to use. I addition, I hope that the speed of the website could be improved. "
ServiceInsight,"ServiceInsight is a great tool for collecting information and seemingly for dispatching work and tracking open tasks.  The system seems a bit cumbersome when trying to look for specific work order/PM's because of the limited screen layout. Also, when pulling a site history and opening one work order, I cannot easily go back and select the next item in the list (or preferred next item to view).  Thank you for requesting feedback!"
ServiceInsight,"Need to increase log in time, logs out too soon, and often. It will randomly send me to the login screen, even if I am in the middle of use. Need to be able to attach multiple pics at one time, for site, roof inspections. Should be linked to Site Tools so all equipment info is available on both platforms."
ServiceInsight,Modernize the UI and make the loading faster.
ServiceInsight,Servicesinsight is a very useful tool where you can register all the client request
ServiceInsight,"*wish I wouldn't have to enter the Password everytime I login on the mobile app.

*The mobile app times out during doing live work orders, it ends up having to close out and restart during the process of doing a live work order.

*Also, calling the help desk, for CBRE, they do not seem to know how to work the desktop/or mobile app at all.

*There needs to be up to date training on the usefulness of the application.  The training on talent coach is outdated.

*The opening of the dashboard says: Announcement: New Global ServiceInsight Dashboard Coming Soon!. Well its years later it has still not come yet.
*Uploading images is quirky. or viewing them only one at a time (maybe a hover feature would be nice so you don't have to open every image if they're not disticntively marked by the techs)
*Site History, when you filter and open one you have to refilter and search over again if you click on an item.  It would be nice if you could back button and go back to your same filtered items without having to start from scratch.

*The technicians frustration with all of the errors and starting over makes the job a little more difficult as well causes KPI to be affected."
ServiceInsight,Best Tool.
ServiceInsight,Stop it from crashing and having to log in 20 times a day and speed it up so it doesn't take 5 minutes to load
ServiceInsight,Test fully on mobile devices - some functions are great on desktop but fail in the field with a mobile pda.
ServiceInsight,Training very difficult and very unclear to use the platform. 
ServiceInsight,It would be helpful to receive an email notice when vendors add quotes and updates to the work orders. There are way too many work orders we have to manage and cannot go in each to check for updates.
ServiceInsight,Not got thu Uset
ServiceInsight,Not at this time.
ServiceInsight,Make the aMFM app more stable for use. Especially when completing inspections.
ServiceInsight,"I need to take more training to better utilize SI7 
The mobile app is sometimes difficult to navigate and I use that about 25% of the time as opposed to my laptop "
ServiceInsight,Interfaces are not generally user friendly. One login for all applications would be ideal. Too many logins currently and its very confusing.
ServiceInsight,"Sinceramente, desconozco el uso de esta herramienta con ese nombre. En la actualidad gestionamos varios clientes y no sabemos cuanto sistemas usamos."
ServiceInsight,It's a good CMMS and easy to use
ServiceInsight,"it could improve to be better than today.
It is interesting if we can have the opportunity for modify the status. In the other company, the sftw has lot of more intuictive status.

ServiceInsight,Chinese version is not actual correct. It looks like Machine Translation. It could be improved as many account use SI in Chinese. I still have some comments can share with the people who's really want to have. I want to say I think SI is good if the cunnrent funtions can be more friendly and effectively to use. You can find me on teams with [email].
ServiceInsight,System is slow we cant create our own site PMs need to be able to created PMs for task that do not have an asset number 
ServiceInsight,Less computer lingo in the menus. Gear it more towards everyday users not familiar with lingo.
ServiceInsight,"I have experience with several work order systems.  I am new to this system and find it to be more challenging than some and less challenging than others.  So far, WorkDay is the best system I have experience with."
ServiceInsight,There should be some video tutorials embedded in applications for engineers to know more about applications. Self-help articles should be easy to go.
ServiceInsight,Great help for my job. 
ServiceInsight,Most of my work with ServiceInsight is deploying it to new clients and assisting them in understanding the benefits f the tool. I am not a regular user although I am a certified user
ServiceInsight,"I feel that there should be little reason to speak to the person requesting service. But, there always is a problem of incomplete descriptions or locations or other details that are not listed on the service request. Tracking people down to get details makes my job more difficult than necessary."
ServiceInsight,"Specifically a great improvement can be the push up notifications for the mobile version, this can help avoid due after hour Due WOs. "
ServiceInsight,there need to be more resolution codes to add a work order to. Like hanging a picture. there is no resolution code for that. 
ServiceInsight,"Make it more stable. I have used work order management software for over twenty years with different companies. This is the worst one I've ever used. It crashes multiple times a day, often doesn't respond to what I tell it to do, and has options for the desktop version that aren't available in the mobile version, and vice versa. It's awful. The last company I worked at had about thirty employees, and the work order software was better than this. Do better!"
ServiceInsight,Service Insight for CBRE users are very outdated. The program is very slow and times out and freezes very often so you have to re do orders and can not be sure it has gone through. 
ServiceInsight,"Unless you have passed the training you would not be able to work efficiently, its not a software you can pick up quickly, I have a good handle now of the system but in the beginning it was really hard.  FM's are not required to take the training therefore they find it so difficult to work with it.  my current roll required to pass the course and I did but I could see how others still have a hard time using it. "
ServiceInsight,"1. Interface is very slow it takes a lot of time to load sync and dispatch WO.
2. Interface sometimes (not always) have glitches which sign out clients automatically and they have to reinstall the app to make it work again.
3. some time it is difficult to find client by name when generating SR on their behalf, they are registered in the system, but the name is not visible during the search.
"
ServiceInsight,no.  Maybe making it easier for the vendor to invoice.
ServiceInsight,You can improve by reducing the number of emails sequesters receive upon both opening and closing tickets.
ServiceInsight,generation of reports little difficult meantime many functions need to be change while getting data  
ServiceInsight,It would be helpful to have better instructions/how-to. I use it so infrequently so I have to refresh my memory every time I put in a ticket
ServiceInsight,None so far
ServiceInsight,the Problem Code is difficult to classify accurately so I receive the DONOTREPLY mails quite often.
ServiceInsight,"When logged in, it times out too quickly, sometimes while I'm still processing work. It barely gives a few minutes before it times out.
Results in signing in a minimum of at least 20 times a day."
ServiceInsight,It can be a bit challenging when creating a new caller profile or navigating the drop down list for finding existing callers. I can find the profiles in SI7 but not in Service insight/jarvis unfortunately. Also the default site that loads up for existing callers cannot be changed when the caller has transferred to a different branch. This may be worth looking into to reduce call handling time on a call. Furthermore the phone number field would be ideal if it was made a mandatory field as this is overlooked sometimes by advisors and makes it a bit difficult when chasing urgent jobs.
ServiceInsight,I often experience delays in entering work orders because the website will not load for long periods of the day. 
ServiceInsight,Very good tool and easy to use
ServiceInsight,Would be nice if attachments were compatible with Google sheets so that we could open them. 
ServiceInsight,"It should be easier for the customer. There are to many parameter for the customer to selct, that confuese the employee from the customers"
ServiceInsight,"Service insight should be able to communicate and integrate with other tools like  E log books, Technical complaince register, Harbour ans e permits. 
It would be wonderful, if we make one tool for end to end solution for Planned and corrective maintenece activities."
ServiceInsight,Speed up work order creation time- its very cumbersome for techs. We also really need to figure out a better way to handle landlord information where we have shared responsibility for services to our customers
ServiceInsight,"Sometimes it's not really intuitive and a bit slow and clunky (specially the web version).
It would be nice if i could upload more than one attachment at once.
And also, the mobile version should allow me to correct labor time."
ServiceInsight,Make it more streamlined less is more
Deal IQ,"It would be nice if pipeline deals that aren't vouchered or listed as ""closed"" would produce a pipeline income projection based on $ x %. (i.e. 50% x $100 = $50)"
Deal IQ,Deal IQ was a great addition to our company.
Deal IQ,
Deal IQ,"This program has a significant amount of bugs that need to be addressed in terms of vouchers, comps, etc. "
Deal IQ,"Add a client code field to the commission splits screen so we can enter Funcitonal Unit, Office, Client."
Deal IQ,"truncated, one page entry for invoice request that gets populated into the voucher when the time comes"
Deal IQ,"1) For each market, individuals should be introduced ASAP to the ""process"" of the deal in Deal IQ.  I had to hunt and peck and figure out who to talk to about the process myself and until I knew that, my vouchers were not completely/properly submitted for initial review.

2) We should be able to enter a $0.00 amount for co-broker in the Financial tab when we are not paying the co-broker and instead the seller/landlord or buyer/tenant pays the co-broker direct.  Right now, I don't include it at all in that tab and instead enter it in the Comp tab - truly this data should be populated in both tabs."
Deal IQ,"It would be great if we could export Comp files from Deal IQ when a deal is complete. It was the one nice feature we had when we used Apto. It will save a ton of time creating comps from scratch and that way anyone who uses Deal IQ could pull comps when needed. It would be amazing if we could do this, I think most Client Service Employees would agree! Thank you!"
Deal IQ,I feel that Deal IQ is very user friendly and not necessarily hard but it is very time consuming. I think any steps that can be made to shorten the process of entering in a deal would be helpful. Thank you!
Deal IQ,Expiring deals where I'm not the lead broker are valueless and obscure ones that might benefit from my attention.
Deal IQ,"(1)have ability to keep comments once a deal is closed --much a transaction's history is in comments. 
(2) have area to add options (renewal, termination and expansion) into information. 
(3) have ability to export into lease abstract"
Deal IQ,"With a recent update, we are now required to submit data for deals 'to be shared with CBRE Research.' Our clients require us to have this data be confidential and not shared with anyone. We always have to put 'N/A' in all these required fields, which is tedious. Please remove this requirement if possible."
Deal IQ,"Data entry is cumbersome. Ex - creating a 15 year lease commission schedule involves creating at least 15 new lines. Too many separate pages, too many mouse clicks to navigate to complete one voucher. Being able to send yourself a draft  separate from all the brokers would be helpful.  "
Deal IQ,"There are certain features that should be implemented - sublease executing deal type, better pipeline forecasting "
Deal IQ,Enable to create new deal from existing contacts on closed deal.   Copy Data feature 
Deal IQ,"you should be able to delete upcoming deals that have already been renewed etc.
"
Deal IQ,"It would be great if the info we input would move into the other tabs like:
the number of free rent months could be autopopulated in comps.
Or the OSB info could also automatically moved in the tab that autopopulates the lead broker. (sorry, i can't think of what tab that is).
"
Deal IQ,"Hard to use as a project tool as vouchers muddy the experience.  Overall, great experience."
Deal IQ,"in the financials section, to would be nice to be able to enter dollar amounts with 3-4 decimal points"
Deal IQ,"- The dashboard needs to show the next 50 deals coming up on lease expiration, showing 10 is not actionable and doesn't leave enough time. 

- Allow us to access all of the files when we type in a past deal. We should be able to see the comp and all of the info immediately without uploading a document. "
Deal IQ,Have had issues with commission info being accurate/ real time. Seems like there are delays
Deal IQ,I use it because I have to.  
Deal IQ,"I often will fill out a field and tab out of it....then when I got to review the deal, it says I haven't filled it in.  It's frustrating to have to enter things multiple times."
Deal IQ,"Having used and designed other CRM systems over the last 19 years, I find Deal IQ very limited in its abilities and scope. It has one sole function, and it still has bugs. Provide more functions and reports specifically geared towards pipeline, revenue reports, contract and deal management, and contact management specifically designed to interface with brokers and CSPs. Also, link Deal IQ to MTA to bridge the information gap and show real-time updates regarding deal and broker revenues. Recognize individual ""teams"" and provide flexible revenue reports. Implement a ""Design a report"" feature to choose the fields you wish to incorporate into a report. "
Deal IQ,"Too many fields do not self populate, and there are too many required fields.  It takes too long and every transaction takes multiple attempts and resubmissions"
Deal IQ,"Sometimes doesn't save work. Could be nice to add an ""import"" from excel for financial section."
Deal IQ,"When submitting a revision, I wish it wouldn't create a new voucher again.  Sometimes, there a small revision only.

For Base Rent calculations (consideration) tabs, please allow some modification as sometimes, we have to enter days not months.  so the $ is a bit off because we can't adjust the days. "
Deal IQ,"Would love if there's a way to batch/automate our prospect vetting against salesforce, vouchers, and SPOC's. For example, uploading a list of prospects and flagging the ones who are found in open opportunities, SPOC's, and vouchers."
Deal IQ,We don't get paid if we don't use deal IQ. :) Pretty useful for that regard. 
Deal IQ,"As a Client Services Professional, I would like a way to filter deals by the broker. The only way I know of currently is to add tags. However, this only works for deals I can add tags to. When another CSP creates the deal and doesn't add me, I cannot add a tag."
Deal IQ,better visibility and easier access  needed to documents for everyone involved in the transaction
Deal IQ,"Not intuitive - hard to figure out, cumbersome."
Deal IQ,make it easier to use and to let you know what the error/issues are. Have drop down boxes for everything including the states so we don't have to manually find it.  It's time consuming. Why do we need to fill in the comp when we are giving the comp by filling out the voucher. the system should be able to pull it.
Deal IQ,"It should include:
* link to honorary title calculator. Every broker cares about this, should be an easy link. 
* The MyDeals tab on the homepage website. I need to go to this AND Deal IQ to find out when checks come in and how much I'll make that given week. "
Deal IQ,Continue to have issues with deals showing up when I am part of a team.
Deal IQ,"Allow for an option to generate a draft voucher to send to brokers for review. Better communication when errors, glitches, system outages occur. "
Deal IQ,"I only have ideas when nobody is asking me.  Would be great to somehow connect to global listings.  When a suite is vouchered, it could automatically be removed from global.  "
Deal IQ,I can't think of any- it's a great tool! 
Deal IQ,I sure do!  Deal IQ needs to interface with TransAct.  CBRE's MTA system and Deal IQ need to interface as well.  There is too much duplication of data.  Deal IQ needs to have the capability to track when invoices are sent out.  For a large team like ours with 400+ vouchers/year and the volume of revenue we generate we have to track invoices in a separate excel-based platform.  Also need status/note capability that could help track missing information requests and questions from TA accounting and potential help populate aging reports. 
Deal IQ,just keep improving and keep using broker feedback/input.
Deal IQ,please adjust pipeline view to resize and relocate columns.
Deal IQ,"It's fine for looking up vouchers, spocs, and tracking commissions. However, for true CRM functionality, other platforms are much more useful."
Deal IQ,"It is useful, but it is not user friendly in my opinion. "
Deal IQ,It would be great that when the voucher is submitted so are the calculations (formulas)used as well as partial months.  The rounding is always off and many times we need to adjust commission etc
Deal IQ,Tracking tenants in the prospecting would be useful if you could subset properties that you do Landlord Rep for so that way you can track prospects and use for reports to Landlords like you can do on the software VTS. Most developers prefer us use VTS. 
Deal IQ,"1) Instead of populating the voucher xls form that was created decades ago, DealiQ should send a data feed to transaction accounting upon submission of vouchers.
2) Expand capabilities of DealiQ to allow for controlling property listings; eliminating the need to re-enter property information for  multi-tenant buildings for each transaction."
Deal IQ,I think the biggest issue I have is filtering the info.  It could be a little cleaner IMO.
Deal IQ,No suggestions as of now
Deal IQ,"The contact/tracking entry system is a little clunky, but otherwise DealIQ is awesome.  Love the ability to track all deals/payments/pursuits!"
Deal IQ,"Lead brokers delegate voucher creation to CS and fail to provide all the info. required to complete all the questions asked in Deal IQ.  This delays the process unnecessarily.  As a result of this, it often takes days and multiple attempts to complete a deal/voucher in Deal IQ because of the lack of cooperation. The brokers find it  time-consuming and unnecessary to provide so much info. surrounding their deals. Furthermore, each deal possesses very different and unique circumstances which are very difficult to reflect properly in Deal IQ's parameters."
Deal IQ,Deal IQ has been glichy. Voucher that have been submitted had to be pulled down and resubmitted causing me to not get paid in the appropriate pay period. Not acceptable! 
Deal IQ,Make the pipeline report and spreadsheet relevant to brokers. It is currently only useful for sales management
Deal IQ,"There are a lot of quirks in Deal IQ that I think can be fixed and make things easier...for example, (1) when you start typing a state, it should automatically go to that letter and then give you the relevant states as you continue typing; (2) PLEASE allow for downloading of a DRAFT excel voucher BEFORE all information is input; (3) make agile vouchers easier to input with relevant questions/answers for that type of deal; (4) the drop downs for Pool Accounts etc are not easy to use (need info and cannot search); (5) still having issues with entering contact information (start typing and my contact pops up but cannot get info to stay in fields and/or the fields disappear after information entered and cannot get past ""review"" since info is now missing!; (6) preload accounting email boxes so they popup when you start typing to send a voucher; and (7) make the business codes ALL the same (they are different between Deal IQ, Broker Dashboard, the ones that come with the excel voucher and those you find online!! Very frustrating and waste of tine to have to go thru the entire Deal IQ list each time if you don't type EXACTLY what is there as an option.  Thank you.  "
Deal IQ,"My comments come from the fact that we cannot get information any other way.  We do not have a choice on the use of Deal IQ. It is not intuitive at all.  Also, the process to get a deal number is near impossible to understand and takes WAY TOO LONG."
Deal IQ,Would like to be able to research vouchers by broker. 
Deal IQ,"If for the Landlord side of deals certain things could be stored under the property it correlates to that would be very helpful. Examples would be listing agreements, project numbers, OFACS etc. Also when we duplicate a deal, having an option to keep all the paperwork we have already uploaded would be very helpful and save time."
Deal IQ,"Always have trouble with the info I enter not saving. Typically, in the contact details. I will enter phone/email and find later it was not saved and is missing."
Deal IQ,I get pop up reminders for deals that are no longer pertinent. It has a tendency to fill up my notifications with deals that are not actionable.
Deal IQ,"The glitches where data you have entered are deleted are frustrating. Notifications about updates to the system (new tools, new ways to include data) would be helpful. Easier searches for NAICS codes would be helpful. Better communication with Vouchers/MTA would be great - too many instances of being asked for docs that were already attached or Vouchers telling us they did not see the comments we included. "
Deal IQ,"Constant issues.  
When i update deals, on many occasions, information is voided.   Current update is taking too long and installments sheet still showing multiple invoices even after invoice paid, showing one paid and one still past due.   
I am still waiting on an update of deal that was paid early, then refunded and the deal has not been added back for tracking purposes and revenue update.   "
Deal IQ,Very confusing to input shared expenses and installments.
Deal IQ,Invoice history would make the tool much more valuable
Deal IQ,"It would be much better if it was integrated with other interfaces, like TransAct.  Needing to enter the same information into multiple systems is inefficient and can be a source of errors. "
Deal IQ,It would be so helpful if there was some way to add the ability to have an admin profile.
Deal IQ,More communication about glitches and issues. 
Deal IQ,"I love DIQ. The challenge is knowing how to input deal info, especially consideration and commissions, or the finances section in general, correctly for that particular deal. I'm learning as they come in but it seems like every voucher I've done is different in how it is entered. "
Deal IQ,"* Need to solve issues on Closing the vouchers.  Some vouchers that were already processed years ago, are still sitting in my DIQ.
* Need training on How to utilize the Search feature (parameters, etc): searching for past invoices, companies, commission, etc."
Deal IQ,"Should have separate columns for outside broker and listing broker commissions (%) instead of just lumping them together. This would make it much easier to calculate and verify the commission amounts.  Would also like to see a checklist of documents to include in voucher submission, and to be able to select Norcal Transactions email from a list without always having to type in the email address.  Lastly would like to see (easily) the date, time, and email address sent for my voucher submissions.  Before I finalize my voucher I send a copy to myself to review, but the only message you see is ""voucher sent"".  It needs to include more details on the first page an maybe a message if it has not been sent to Norcal Transactions.  "
Deal IQ,Please add the export function to properties. I have been asking for 3+ years and you have it on all the other categories. The properties function should be incorporated to our market stats
Deal IQ,Include local market vouchers emails so do not need to add every time. Include property type breakdown . For land why do we need to put in SF and acres? One should feed the other. 
Deal IQ,"The one topic I have the hardest time with is when a deal has a second broker and CBRE is paying them. When I input their percentage it calculates wrong unless i have the exact percentage or dollar amount. I am not sure why it pulls from part of the consideration instead of auto calculating to what you are wanting. I think for a new user it would benefit them to have that portion explained thoroughly. For example-on one deal it was brought to my attention to input the percentage as 0.66667, how would a newer user know when to input that information? If there is a way to have the considerations and commissions sync up that would be helpful to the user when putting those percentages in."
Deal IQ,It would be great if it had more functions and was usable as basically a brokers dashboard.  More categories and better interactive uses for properties and executing.
Deal IQ,"There's still some glitches like when you type an address on the 'Bill To' section and as soon as you tab over to the next blank space, it erases the information you typed in previously. 

I'm not sure if it's a human error when a voucher has been process by Transactions but sometimes, they splits are allocated correctly on the voucher but sometimes, one percentage split goes to a different broker when the Deal Reports are generated. So one broker didn't get paid and another was overpaid. 

For the comps, there should be a comp form that is pertinent to either office or industrial leases, we still have to email research separately pertinent details of a lease that should have been on the voucher and submitted to Research, to eliminate double efforts. "
Deal IQ,"Deal IQ should pair with a CRM, to reduce or minimize the data entry duplication.  Deal IQ from my perspective is a management and admin software/tool.  It was not created with the broker/salesperson in mind."
Deal IQ,The biggest issue is the drop down boxes. It makes submitting deals difficult. Sometimes it won't allow me to select an option.
Deal IQ,"Two things:
1. I would love for invoices to be uploaded Deal IQ instead of always having to ask.  
2. For the user type, I wish there was a way to see all options. I know you can type and it pulls up options, but sometimes the use I want isn't there and I end up scrolling through everything to find what fits best."
Deal IQ,I don't think it is super user friendly or intuitive.
Deal IQ,"I like the tool but it has a lot of glitches and ongoing issues. If those get resolved at some point, I would say it is a very worthwhile tool. "
Deal IQ,just keep listening to the users and keep improving. Seamlessness between Deal IQ and Outlook is always something to work on.
Deal IQ,"The worst part of closing a lease is having to spend an hour or so of valuable time working through a dealiq voucher.  (it should be a happy point in time as money is finally booked, and filling out a voucher on DealIq is a soul crushing slog of an hour or more time for me)  Also, been a few years and still don't think the commission calc translates to New York rates.   "
Deal IQ,"The ability to pull more reports (comps from the vouchers, etc.)"
Deal IQ,It would be helpful to have the commission calculations take into account the outside broker share of commission. Currently I have to calculate the commission by hand because the percentages are calculated on the entire commission and not the remaining commission.
Deal IQ,:)
Deal IQ,Nope
Deal IQ,"It would be helpful if a broker's CS could give their deals so that we know if a deal was paid, or if they were included in a deal that was entered by another broker team/CS, or another office.  Also, deals get put into Closed after they are invoiced, even when they haven't been paid, or if the deal is getting paid 50% upon lease execution and 50% on occupancy, which could be months later.  We may have edits or changes, and cannot make them if it has been closed.  We can't make any edits to Closed deals. "
Deal IQ,I love Deal IQ.
Deal IQ,"It would be nice if we had more control over what we see on the dashboard.  There was something else I really wished for the other day, but it's slipping my mind right now ... bummer!  Thank you

"
Deal IQ,"Maybe a training video on a somewhat complicated, but fairly common lease or sale senario could be helpful."
Deal IQ,nope
Deal IQ,"I would like to be able to download an excel version of the voucher template without having to submit or send to my email for a downloadable version. I currently have to delete all recipients in the ""send"" column to be able to get a downloadable version which is a lot of wasted time and an inconvenience.  "
Deal IQ,I only use DealIQ to voucher. Other than that- if we didn't have to submit pipeline can't say we would use it. Maybe if it integrated with outlook to send updates and status of the deal that would be beneficial. 
Deal IQ,Watch the Bill To address and make sure invoices reflect this info. 
Deal IQ,it would be great to have the option to generate a draft voucher (for review) prior to submittal.
Deal IQ,"why do i have to save one file at a time when getting the deal summary via internal email...i'd like to save all the deal files at the same time
"
Deal IQ,"I would like to be able to search for vouchers within a 5 mile radius, or to be shown adjacent zip codes to my search."
Deal IQ,More advanced report functions.  Including TEAM reporting.  The ability to export or search all CRM data that has been uploaded to the system in ANY capacity.  
Deal IQ,It would be helpful and time saving if all the deals inputted could be prefilled and ready to export every quarter for the Lease and Sale Transactions report. Or if the deals we enter in could be automatically reflected in their data sheet similar to the pipeline report for management. 
Deal IQ,"For vouchering, there should be an easier way to enter the commission calculation and broker teams. It was much faster/easier just using a spreadsheet. It would be helpful at least to have our team pre-populate in the broker section."
Deal IQ,"keep records after deal closes
abstract terms of the deal"
Deal IQ,"DealIQ is very confusing to use. Is there language in a contract that would help me indetify if it's a lease landlord, or lease tenant, etc?"
Deal IQ,Issue deal numbers in 2 hours or less
Deal IQ,"I love everything about Deal IQ other than how long it takes to fill out a voucher.  I spend so much time on this, and any time I spend on vouchering, I'm not making money.  It is easy to use and very easy to track commissions. There needs to be an option not to add a property address because new development deals don't get assigned an address until long after the commission is paid. "
Deal IQ,allow user to have more control of their dashboard/what they see. 
Deal IQ,"It would be helpful to add the following:
1. OPEX dropdown option under Financials Tab (Add Consideration) instead of Other Brokerage Fee
2. Standard formulas on how to calculate required fields
3. Specific requirements in parenthesis (monthly or yearly)  "
Deal IQ,Voucher form a little confusing 
Deal IQ,"Tons of comments/questions/suggestions for DealIQ! I'll try to be brief. 

- UX/UI needs tons of improvement, along with the process flow. 

- I'm confused about the full purpose and functionality of DealIQ in regards to how the retail team is using it. From what I understand, DealIQ is primarily an accounting tool used to support the brokerage with accounting transactions, projections, commissions, etc. The disconnect is that we are also trying to use the system as a CRM and relying on it for our sales pipeline, which does not work. 

- EX: Entering all the contact information and details when first setting up an asset. If the system is serving as a CRM then I would want to include information such as contacts, marketing strategy, requirements, budgets and commissions. However, when proceeding to voucher the ""business leads"" into actual commissioned deals, there are situations, where it's necessary to use system work-arounds to complete the voucher, even when those workarounds compromise the integrity of the data being entered and don't necessarily make sense from a sales/marketing /data standpoint. 

--Example: Should be able to enter 0% for an outside broker that is not getting paid directly by CBRE. It does not make sense to later have to go back and delete the outside broker completely from the deal just to proceed. I would suggest adding a check box or drop down on the outside broker commissions page that can later be checked if CBRE is not paying that commission. That way, the system can leave outside broker commissions off of the final voucher if it's not necessary for accounting purposes.  The outside broker is still a part of the deal, even if we are not paying them directly. It doesn't make sense to manually enter extra data for research purposes when even basic information/data is not being entered and documented accurately. 

- As a CRM, the system, process flow and best practices, that are currently in place are limited and do not provide enough functionality. 

- Retail brokers are not entering pipeline information. The system is not user friendly and lacks functionality, which is why many of the retail brokers refuse to use the system properly or take full advantage of the features available.
 
- Difficult to manage and keep up with access, delegation and updating for user/group privileges and different asset types. 

-Could use more clearly defined best practices, controls and overall process for setting up deals and individual/team access to it, in order to avoid duplicates and user dependence on system administrators. 

-Could use additional fields for secondary contacts as well as the option to add additional contacts for each individual - cell phone and office phone - work email and personal email. 

	- Lack of integration with other systems creates tons of inefficiencies. APIs could be DealIQs best friend!!! APIs are needed, especially if the system is not going to be improved to serve as a CRM or to help manage/track various assets, clients, prospects and the sales pipeline.  
	
	- Need the ability to independently pull detailed reports on assets. 
	
	- Calendar integration would be great
	
	- Campaign Logic Integration would be great! 
	
	- Incorporating the new agreements process within DealIQ should be a priority. It's literally a duplicate process that is all already entered into DealIQ and could be tracked and managed in the system for better efficiency. 
	
	- Silly to limit the characters in a document title to 64 in order to upload it. It's a minor annoyance but it is one more extra steps to go back into computer files, change the name of the file and then re-upload. Additionally, changing the name of the file creates issues when the broker later tried to search for the file that they originally created. 
	
The purpose of tech is to help streamline operations for faster/better  results. Adding more systems and more points of entry only adds more work for the brokerage team and additional manual entry provides greater opportunities for mistakes and human error. There are APIs and Indexing systems that could assist with these tasks , while also saving the company time and overhead costs.
"
Deal IQ,"Since a there's a lot of people in transactions that processes the deal, they can't remember who should sign the deal reports and who gets the invoice, there should be like a pulldown menu somewhere as to who should get the deal reports for approval and who should get the invoices (either what you indicated or sent to the team to be forwarded to client by the team) . Sometimes, the deal reports go the main broker but doesn't actually have the voucher to check it against. To minimize the errors, it should be approved by the delegated authority for that team (not necessarily the main broker). "
Deal IQ,Is there a mobile friendly app?
Deal IQ,"For retail specifically....after adding the available spaces to a property (ex. a shopping center), it would be great to be able to have each space accounted for individually in the pipeline instead of total square footage of the shopping center. Then when you go to the list of spaces under a property, you should be able to click a button to move a particular space to a Executing Deal and have all of the information populate. This would help with pipeline management and eliminate the need for duplication of properties or recalculating total square footage so that the pipeline is current. 

As far as the interface goes, it would be helpful to have the Deal ID# show with all of the other deal information in the Prospecting and Executing stages. We are required to submit this number to our Managing Director and we have to pull it from the URL, which is fine. But it would make more sense to see it directly with the other deal info."
Deal IQ,Our accounting department is frequently unable to view comments left on vouchers - can you kindly fix that?
Deal IQ,1. In vouchers you should be able to search when a company was a tenant or if they were a landlord.  You should also be able to tell which sales professional worked on what side of the deal.  This is good information to track relationships for a few reasons many of which are business development related.  
Deal IQ,"get rid of it.  try another program.

"
Deal IQ,In addition to voucher and pipeline we use it for workflow management.  Would be great if we could build in task templates for each deal.
Deal IQ,Integration of the Pipeline feature
Deal IQ,"Features needed:
1.  Ability to print copy of PDF invoice once it has been created/uploaded by accounting.
2.  When prior deal is duplicated (example for lease renewal) all original uploaded files should be duplicated or at least have option to duplicate."
Deal IQ,"1. It should list 5x more on the upcoming expirations page as opposed to making us export in excel (which never comes out clean). 

2. Match the actual deals in the system with DealIQ. There are multiple that have been already been paid or weren't paid in full and it doesn't do a good job of tracking these. "
Deal IQ,"I know were only required to fill out the fields with an asterisk next to it, but not sure why there's all the other fields in system if it's not required, I guess to me that's a little confusing."
Deal IQ,Make a phone app
Deal IQ,"I think there are a lot of room for improvements. I think there should be some separation of lease and sale deals. I also think sale deals should not move to closed once they go through the system but should when they are effectively closed and paid in full. This may not be the need or issue with most teams, but the volume of my team is extraordinary. Having an ability to possible organize and customize my dashboard and deals would be extremely helpful as I am constantly going back and searching for deals that are moved to closed but not closed and need updating; paid commissions, first and second half; etc, 
It could be more useful for the team and not just transaction accounting and pipelines but in my opinion needs more finessing. :)"
Deal IQ,It would be great if we could see the status of the submitted voucher...i.e. what stage of the process it is in.
Deal IQ,"I think there could be a ton of improvements to the platform that would likely need to be done through a call. With that being said, it is a great program to use and I am happy with it. I think it could be so much more. "
Deal IQ,Every way possible!
Deal IQ,The information accuracy is inconsistent. When I notice an inconsistency I am unable to track down source documents to verify.
Deal IQ,none at this time
Deal IQ,"I've only explored the features briefly, but it would be beneficial to have a better way of finding properties (ie for Canada) I was having difficulty locating an address for a specific property at first. Being able to edit where they are located and adding additional details about each property would be more beneficial. 
"
Deal IQ,Provide standard formulas in sections where amounts or percentages are required to avoid errors.
Deal IQ,"When downloading deal reports, spreadsheets should include a separate cell for sq. ft. of the transaction."
Deal IQ,"There should be a way to easily input repetitive data in vouchers. In many ways, it would be faster to use an excel spreadsheet than Deal IQ. "
Deal IQ,"I don't mind dealIq, but to recommend to a colleague, if we don't use we don't get paid. :) 
it is very useful, because the team would not get paid without using. "
Deal IQ,n/a
Deal IQ,"Importing/Exporting Contacts
Better updates on upcoming leases
Voucher search more fluid.

I have ideas and always open to talking!!
818-268-0732 (C)
Dalton.saberhagen@cbre.com
"
Deal IQ,There should be a way to search comments for specific text that will allow us to find deals.
Deal IQ,"Would be helpful to be able to submit draft voucher to yourself (without all fields being filled in) so brokers can review prior to submission. 
"
Deal IQ,"It would be nice if we could set a 6 month or 1 year reminder, that would send a note to the broker (or show on the broker's Outlook calendar)."
Deal IQ,The pipeline report section needs some TLC. I have multiple ideas and would love to sit down with the Deal IQ folks to discuss them.
Deal IQ,"I think when entering vouchers, the NAIC codes are terrible.  Most aren't even close to being in there as an option, so i guess.  Overall, i think it's user friendly.  I liked when the email updates about Gross Commission went up had $$$ amounts on them.  I've noticed lately they are missing $$$ amounts."
Deal IQ,"LOL. Short of you whispering in my ear where everything goes as I fill out the vouchers, your program is SOLID. MAYBE - a button at the end to send a ""PREVIEW VOUCHER"" to the brokers involved. I do the Data Entry - but get nervous when I fill everything out, only to not hit the final SEND button, because the Broker requests to see the entries for himself/herself first. When I cut off the final step - I worry that the entries would zero-out or reset. "
Deal IQ,The process of properly selecting which deals go into a pipeline report and then exporting and opening the pipeline reports in cumbersome
Deal IQ,"It would be great if we could go back to the place where we left off in Pipeline Reports after a deal has been updated.  Once you go out of PR, you have go scroll back through all of the deals to get back to where you left off.  Thank you! "
Deal IQ,Exporting capabilities
Deal IQ,"When I click into SHOW APP, it always goes to the last voucher screen instead of the home screen. That seems like an easy bug to fix. Also- a quick link to the honorary title calculator would be helpful. Most brokers care about that and want to see where they stack up for their next title bump. Thanks! "
Deal IQ,Wish it would be easier to use when vouchering international deals. 
Deal IQ,"The pipeline report needs a lot of help. Its just not a useful tool for me, as I like to monitor my deal flow, historic, current and future, in a comprehensive report with easy to aggregate and analyze totals, such as the pre-Deal IQ pipeline was structured. Otherwise it's a great tool overall, and only wish there was a pipeline report structured more for the user."
Deal IQ,It should sync with Broker's Dashboard in Tri State
Deal IQ,A lot of the CRM is geared towards office leasing. It would be helpful if the deal progression could be more suited to a retail deal 
Deal IQ,"when a voucher is created, their should be a default recipient and the broker then adds others. For instance, in my case, omahavouchers@cbre.com should be the default recip, always."
Deal IQ,"When I log in to revise a voucher, the most up-to-date one should be in there. "
Deal IQ,Report functions need to be easy to produce and should be able to be download to .pdf form.
Deal IQ,N/A
Deal IQ,Is there any way to have a link to Vendors in the system who have been given Rebates in the past so we will know how to code/enter that field with the correct name?
Deal IQ,Make it more user friendly.
Deal IQ,"I don't use Deal IQ very much and I am trying to utilize it more. So that probably influences my answers as to why I find it ""somewhat"" difficult/useful. I'm sure that will get better as I learn my way around the platform. "
Deal IQ,When a deal has multiple installments they are not listed in date order. It would be great if we could sort the order based on the number of the installments and/or the date.
Deal IQ,"I use Deal IQ for limited uses.  It is very effective for tracking commissions, finding comps, researching vouchers and other.  I do not use the sales management functions much (Pipeline Only)."
Deal IQ,Deal IQ is still clumsy and has fields that are not workable with many of the transactions.  Acres should be a choice instead of square feet if land.  There are other annoying attributes to the program as well.
Deal IQ,"Please keep adding features and improvements! It would be helpful to produce charts of prospective income, multiplying potential fee and likelihood to arrive at a projection. More robust reminder options would also be helpful. Thank you."
Deal IQ,"very glitchy platform, always seems to have something not working quite right "
Deal IQ,"DEALIQ should link directly to transact to provide a more accurate, seamless forecasting tool. "
Deal IQ,the calculation's in the consideration and allocation tend to not add up correctly.  Always having to adjust the math from excel we use is time consuming
Deal IQ,"There should be the ability to enter the lease rate, OPEX, or price per SF to calculate commissions. All comp fields should state the rate should be entered as the annual rate. "
Deal IQ,"The system has zero automation or workflow built-in, making it extremely inefficient. UX/UI needs some attention - the design and flow is not intuitive.  As far as I can tell, the system is used to help accounting with data entry and record management. Does not make sense to then have all of the key communication happen outside of the system. There is no way to tell what the true status of the commission payment is, although there are fields indicating that it might. Still have to email accounting (outside of system) to figure out the status of anything going on - when check is received, dispersed, etc. or why anything might be delayed. No record of history or what is going on, unless you do extra work to copy/paste or make extra notes outside of the email threads with accounting. Communication should be happening within the system and notification emails should accompany that. The system needs more functionality, workflow and ease of use if it is ever going to be fully adopted and actually helpful.  The sales pipeline is pulled from this system, which can't be very accurate because the brokers don't use the system as a CRM and there is no true way to track leads and all the detail needed.  Deal IQ has no functionality as a CRM, doesn't support asset management or link with property management and zero integration with other systems. It's not efficient to have a million systems that require 100% manual entry. Contracts process should also be handled through this system instead of separately since it's literally duplicate manual entry."
Deal IQ,None. It is just necessary to use Deal IQ for submitting vouchers.
Deal IQ,"Yeah, I would like to be notified when other brokers are pursuing my prospects or clients. I would also like to be notified if I'm pursing theirs to be fair. I would like auto-notifications to be set up for lease expirations, option periods, and other vital timing occurrences within a lease term. "
Deal IQ,"It would be great to have the ability to automatically move ""spaces"" entered under a property into its own deal.

Say we have a retail center with 5 available spaces...we enter all of those spaces and their SF under the shopping center name as 1 deal. Once we have interest in a particular space, we can click a button and it would create a new deal specifically for that space. It would also recalculate the SF for the shopping center so that our pipeline numbers remain the same."
Deal IQ,not easy to get started - need a step by step guide
Deal IQ,I need to take more time working with the program - I only touch the surface right now
Deal IQ,It's not very mobile friendly 
Deal IQ,Great tools enjoy working in it and it has saved lots of production time.  Need all professionals to get on board.  Awesome Tool
Deal IQ,"I'm still pretty new with it, yet it's been a useful tool."
Deal IQ,Keep upgrading to make it user friendly
Deal IQ,would like ability to see all my deals on one page
Deal IQ,Brokers need additional training on using Deal IQ for Pipeline tracking as well as commission tracking.  
Deal IQ,I would like Deal IQ to sync with CBRE's accounting software.  Also need to have land vouchers only require acres not square footage.  
Deal IQ,"please make it simpler to invoice for commissions, everything is on the broker to transact, then do all the work to comply with each and every question from CBRE accounting then to get the invoice and follow-up for collection with the clients.. More work and less efficient use of broker time. no one speaks to the broker they just make multiple request for more paper work to download the file. "
Deal IQ,"Deal IQ is okay but could be great! Features Id like to see per page:
1. Getting Started - I'd like to be able to rename documents directly after being uploaded. I'd like to be able to drag documents vs. just uploading them. I'd like it if the office I work from is saved and do not want to add it every time. 
2. Lease Details/Tenant Information. I spend to much time looking for the right Business Type/Use ID. Anyway we can make the search easier? maybe be able to control search? the menu to open up so we can see it better? I have to scroll a few times to get to the right use. Many times the use makes no sense.
3. Financials/Consideration. I'd like to be able to drag/move around lines. Sometimes we accidently skip a line, or forget there is free rent, I'd like to be able to move them up or down if needed. 
4. Lease COMP. I want a BOX just for NNNs. Why can't we have a specific place to add the NNNs (other than the comments). 
Thank you! 
"
Deal IQ,"App is difficult, goes down often"
Deal IQ,"My ""2022 Total"" amount keeps changing which is very unsettling and make me question if I'm being paid the proper amounts. As someone who relies on DealIQ, this makes me incredibly nervous. "
Deal IQ,Better reports. 
Deal IQ,It's WAY too long to voucher a deal
Deal IQ,"It used to be that when I added a contact in DealIQ and selected the ""Add to Contacts"" box, that the contact would import into Outlook. That hasn't happened for some time, so I'm double entering contacts in both places.
Additionally, it would be nice to be able to sort deals in some way besides newest to oldest. Maybe that's there and I need to look harder.
That said, it works as well for my role as a Transaction Manager as it did when I was a broker. Now that we own part of VTS, any chance of incorporating their data and some of their features into DealIQ?"
Deal IQ,Solution to their being multiple of each property/landlord
Deal IQ,"There should be links or access to Outlook, VTS, site iq and co star on the site.  The more brokers can access straight from here the more likely it will become everyone's dashboard."
Deal IQ,It duplicates some deals and is hard to track / trust sometimes. 
Deal IQ,"It would be nice to have the option to enter Landlords and Tenants' names (and buyers and sellers) in two ways: the LLC / legal entity names associated with the property AND also their commonly used name. That way when we run reports we know which deals are for specific clients (we can see ""Prologis"", LINK Industrial, etc as opposed to xxxxx, LLC)"
Deal IQ,"Only thing I can think of is when I put in a email address to send vouchers such as DCVouchers@cbre.com, I wish that it would just populate it so I would not have to type it in everytime."
Deal IQ,"I don't understand why we don't have a system that is integrated from a database, prospecting, email, and closing files.  "
Deal IQ,"YES! :) 
1) Have the considerations lines be moveable so if you realize you mis-entered, you don't have to reenter every line, you can enter it at the bottom and pull it to the top, or wherever it needs to go.
2) Have the deal 'team' be automatically generated on the commissions tab so you don't have to enter them individually every time.
3) When you hit ""submit"", have it be a spinning circle so we know it submitted.  Sometimes it doesn't seem like it so we end up hitting it again creating extra unnecessary voucher versions.

THANK YOU! "
Deal IQ,"It's hard to use DealIQ as a project management platform. Good for checking invoices, vouchers and SPOC list.  Not good for actually completing deals.  I tried and had to move back to Excel.  Something more like Slack?"
Deal IQ,Very disappointed that you did a system upgrade at the end of the year when I needed critical income and tax information 
Deal IQ,"not at the moment, but when I do I usually share via chat with DIQ folks. :)"
Deal IQ,Lately the web page has not been loading and I can barely access. IT has helped me several times and it only works for 1-2 days at a time. Very frustrating.
Deal IQ,The fields for information have to better match the type of deal.
Deal IQ,Sometimes info in certain fields does not save. Particularly the contact/address fields. I often have to go back and fill them out a second or third time.
Deal IQ,"If it doesn't already exist, there should be a single point of contact for Deal IQ to reach out to about issues or questions. If this does exist, please send SPOC info to the brokers and CSCs. "
Deal IQ,"I do not like the amount of time it takes to enter information into Deal IQ.  The amount of information which has to be repeatedly entered is frustrating as is the total amount of transaction information to generate a commission invoice.  

The monthly rents could alternatively be entered as a cost per RSF then Deal IQ could calculate the monthly rent.  The broker would then compare the monthly rent in Deal IQ with the monthly rent in the lease for accuracy.  I believe this would be much faster and less vulnerable to error.  

 "
Deal IQ,"I'd like to see more functionality with Deal IQ.  Better deal stages/custom deal stages based on where we are in the project.  

Projecting pipelines into Commissions would be a GREAT tool. and seems fairly easy to fix.  

Adding sublease deals to the execution tabs...right not it isn't easy to use for subleases. "
Deal IQ,"It would be tremendous helpful if it synced up with Microsoft tools.  Being able to send an email within DealIQ that would also show up in outlook would be most efficient. Same for saved contacts.  
Wish it were easier to scroll through pipeline to provide updates/edits.  Also, it would be helpful if it had capability to send notification on projects that need updating for purposes of streamlines monthly reporting to sales management. 
For prospects entered into dealiq, it would be helpful if the software had the capabilties to scrap the web for recent company news (i.e. leadership changes, M&A activity, funding new, etc.), which signals to the broker that we should be following up with the prospect.  "
Deal IQ,Would be nice to track comps/transaction market information as it converts from prospecting to a done/vouchered deal.  
Deal IQ,"I'd love more notifications, reminders, yearly reminders about leases expiring. More tools to help remind me to stay in front of client between transactions. "
Deal IQ,Get sales force
Deal IQ,"It would be very helpful if we could see the deals that our brokers are included in so that we know what has been processed, and what has been paid. Also, it would be helpful if a deal was not moved to closed until it was fully paid, not just processed by Accounting.   Also, it would be nice to be able to remove yourself from deals.  There are some old transactions that I was on years ago, that I am still getting alerts for and they are listed in my deal history."
Deal IQ,Provide comprehensive training and make inputs more straightforward and easier to understand using the correct RE termi
Deal IQ,"I would use Deal IQ if it were an effective CRM. Right now I only use it because I have to update my pipeline, and do research on vouchers."
Deal IQ,"Information is inconsistent with ADP Paystub.  Old inaccurate information has not been updated.  Useful information regarding actual buyer, actual seller, PSF, cap rate, sub market  and lead broker requires research. "
Deal IQ,"It would be helpful if items that are unpaid, didn't go into closed since they aren't paid.  Maybe a separate tab for items that are due or past due would be helpful when we have to collect."
Deal IQ,database capability needs to be enhanced so when a transaction closes we can maintain record and information from transaction. 
Deal IQ,You ask for information to be put in but the same information cannot be taken out. 
Deal IQ,"Add an export feature to properties, its the only one that doesn't have it. Deal IQ is helpful and it could be a 100x's more powerful if you linked some features together, I am happy to explain on a call, too much to type, Dan Rattay 302-379-8801."
Deal IQ,"What happened to the i-pad app???
i used it a lot."
Deal IQ,"There needs to be another status of deals between ""Executing"" and ""Closed,"" I would suggest ""Vouchered"" or ""Pending""."
Deal IQ,"When I have a deal with multiple splits from various offices, it's sometimes difficult to get everything to add up, it's not always self explanatory ... would be amazing to have a feature with a RE calculator handy. Also, I have some deals where I have to include a rebate to a client and then a fee to a pool account ... not everyone knows what these mean, it would be handy if there was some sort of information.  In the commissions section, it would be amazing if I could see in deal IQ what's been paid vs. having to look up each deal one by one.  I hope this makes sense!  Thank you"
Deal IQ,My only complaint is that there is so much data entry required. I don't have a solution but it doesn't help us manage time very well.
Deal IQ,"In the tenant tab the field ""Business Type / Use ID"" there don't seem to be a lot of choices. Any word I type in the search bar (example ""Moving"") almost always yields no results and then I pick a type that doesn't necessarily capture what the company really does. NAICS codes don't work/pull up any results. Maybe I am not searching correctly (and maybe it doesn't really matter...)."
Deal IQ,I think there is tremendous opportunity using DealIQ.  Hesitate simply b/c historically we have not stayed committed to our CRM offerings.
Deal IQ,"On the Business Type/Use ID - These really need to be updated to make better sense. None of them should start with ""Other"" and whatever is after the word ""Other"" is what that type should start with.  It takes too long to find correct Type."
Deal IQ,"there needs to be more auto populate for the team commission financial area and escrow info
"
Deal IQ,Being able to search the comp for my deal immediately. You have to go into the files typically. 
Deal IQ,If it's possible I would like to see the duplicate (Dual Rep) vouchers not getting mixed up (names of the clients). Other than that all good.  
Deal IQ,"Adding a column in the consideration section that allows for the OSB calculations, so that they are not combined."
Deal IQ,the vouchering system is cumbersome and takes a lot of time to complete and compile all data then once submitted their is always added questions and more data needed. 
Deal IQ,Wish tasks could be sorted/filtered better - for example by person assigned. 
Deal IQ,"The entire system is redundant and overly elaborate.  The voucher system is TERRIBLE!!!  I don't know why, but information will not save, the review process for the vouchers is ridiculous and adds complications due to a convoluted system.  I have used other methods of payment/commission processing and deal/transaction/activity monitoring.  DealIQ is BY FAR the worst system I have ever used.  It should be summarily scrapped and a new system implemented.  Preferably a proven system, not a bespoke system created by CBRE.  This not not gone well on our own. "
Deal IQ,"Make the STATE field so that you can just hit the ""A"" 3 times to bring up Arizona. It would save time as my hand would not have to leave the keyboard to move to the mouse and gp to pull-down menu"
Deal IQ,"I would love to coordinate a zoom meeting and give some suggestions on what I think could make Deal IQ more useful for brokers. I have a new partner and this is our way of making sure nothing slips through the cracks and there are a couple of things I think could be added to really help!

Deal IQ,"If something is mandatory, it needs to be marked with a red asterisk or something similar. I've gotten early invoice requests sent back for items that were ""mandatory"" but not marked."
Deal IQ,"Sometimes I have issues with DealIQ not loading updated information
The tasks would be nice to be able to see from the prospecting deal tab so that you can assign a follow up task, then once it is complete it goes to a list of completed tasks to see what you've already done
Additionally, if it was easy to set a follow up task once complete, it would streamline how we use it "
Deal IQ,"Work out the quirks!! Ex. When you start typing 1st letter of state, it should go to that letter and then continue to narrow down as you type...should not have to scroll down; Business type - should make easier to find (have to scroll thru WHOLE list and then back again to find correct/best option & does not even match the list we have with the Excel version of the voucher); When you pick ""Agile"", should not require square footage; Also, it is difficult to ask questions of the local accounting team about entering information in Deal IQ when they don't even use the system!  The Deal IQ support team itself is very helpful but sometimes need accounting's assistance with voucher nuances in Deal IQ.  Accounting cannot see into Deal IQ at all! AND many clerical mistakes occur because accounting has to re-enter the information into MTA that I already took the time to enter into Deal IQ…that does not make sense to me :( ....AND ALLOW FOR DELEGATES!!"
Deal IQ,"When dealing with complex vouchers with many splits, it would be nice if every math column allowed for multiple decimal places.  I think some do, but not all.  Thank you! "
Deal IQ,Quite a few delays and errors in past due fees and/or totals.
Deal IQ,"I did not give Deal IQ a ""very easy"" to use grade because it still has quirks that should already have been fixed by now...long overdue.  For some quick examples, (1) not being able to start typing a state name and it goes to the letters you are typing (it only goes to the 1st letter) OR (2) the fact that the business codes are very cumbersome to find and do not align with those on the excel version of the voucher. Also, it is difficult to ask questions of the local accounting team about entering information in Deal IQ when they don't even use the system!  The Deal IQ team is very helpful but need accounting at times with voucher nuances.  They cannot see Deal IQ at all! AND since they have to retype the info, there are often mistakes made in the transfer. This makes for more work and time since you now have to meticulously review the deal report for errors and request corrections as needed. And a suggestion - have Deal IQ also send an email when a calendared task is due. "
Deal IQ,"Could be improved if we did not need to duplicate data input, specifically regarding projected closing dates."
Deal IQ,DealIQ work for looking for vouchers and seeing what deals CBRE has done. It is not great as a CRM.
Deal IQ,"none, pretty easy"
Deal IQ,Some of info could auto populate to make things more efficient.  Seems the same info has to be entered every time .
Deal IQ,"Needs to be able to do deals in other countries. Without it being able to change currency it takes extra time to convert deals in Deal IQ and then have accounting convert them back for the invoice. All countries should be on the same DealIQ system. 
Not being able to see commissions of my teams because I am not receiving commissions is also a hassle. I put the deal into the system, I know what the amount is, I should be able to track in the commissions tab to better serve my brokerage team. 
"
Deal IQ,"Would like to see more automation.  For example; if we have to enter the rent in one section, it shouldn't ask us for the rent per SF in another section.  The system already has both of the numbers needed and should calculate automatically.  "
Deal IQ,only reason to use it is that you have to in order to get vouchers in
Deal IQ,including the title promotion calculations as part of Deal IQ would be super helpful and motivating
Deal IQ,"Fix the rounding issue between Deal IQ and the excel voucher, it's often off 1¢"
Deal IQ,"Outlook integration- PLEASE! It would be so much more useful and helpful if there was a way to integrate with Outlook via add-in or connector, especially for pipeline and deal tracking. Right now, as a broker, I only use it for tracking commissions, and am in need of some of the tools for pipeline, CRM, etc... However, without some kind of integration/quick and easy desktop app, it is burdensome to use. "
Deal IQ,Not being able to access all of the data on past deals is not great. We should be able to populate the same landlords and tenants on renewals as well and it seems the admins cannot pull that data easily because they cannot access it once processed.
Deal IQ,Time consuming to prepare documents to be uploaded.
Deal IQ,"In vouchers - CONSIDERATION tab, it would be a time saver if there was a copy/paste or duplicate feature. We could enter the first line and duplicate the rest of the lines, so the type, period, and rate are pre-populated and we would only have to type in the rent. Kind of like how the timesheet submittal works in MyCBRE."
Deal IQ,email reminders for  expirations or renewals would be great.  Also if I didn't have to search through closed tab for projects that payments are still due.
Deal IQ,"Make the Voucher Comments box larger or so that it's easier to see what you're typing for the ones with longer notes section. 

The Sort function doesn't really seem to work. Or at least it's not helpful if I'm trying to make sure my tracking sheet includes the most recently completed vouchers. Ideally this would be sortable by Lease Execution date. I'm not sure what ""Close Date"" means for leases? 

Same comment for the ""Filter"" - it would be great to be able to filter by Lease Execution date vs Lease Start or Close Date. 

I sincerely appreciate the Deal IQ support team's excellent support and problem solving!
"
Deal IQ,Same comments as always - Rounding issues between deal iq and excel spreadsheet. Need a better way than to handle manually. 
Deal IQ,It used to be great. Now app always down or needing update and data unreliable. Seems like understaffed and/ or underfunded. 
Deal IQ,"1. Need a button (Yes or No) that allows for indication of a combination of two vouchers for one invoice for dual rep deals signaling to accounting only one invoice should be prepared.

2.  Once invoice is prepared as PDF it should able to be accessed by producer if they want to print out, email or send to client.  simple as button that says ""Download copy of invoice"""
Deal IQ,Scrap the entire system!!!  just start over!
Deal IQ,Not sure if its DealIQ or our vouchering/invoicing process but this never seems to work. 
Deal IQ,"Nope...all seems well.
Thanks"
Deal IQ,"My Pipeline Report should reflect gross commissions attributable to me, not the sum of all commissions of deals I am working on. For example, if I am a 50-50 partner on a deal with a $100k fee, then my pipeline should show $50k."
Deal IQ,"The deal booking/invoicing system should be streamlined into Salesforce. Deal IQ is super easy to use but it makes more sense for these systems to be integrated into one place for data collection/tracking. This isn't a Deal IQ issue, no issues at all using Deal IQ - super easy system to use. "
Deal IQ,Please add the ability to drop and drag attachments!
Deal IQ,You need to make the tech more intuitive and you also need broker input so that you think more like the end user.
Deal IQ,"There are so many additions that could be made to deal IQ to make it more user friendly for the CS team that uses it most often. 
International deals are a pain to put in because no other CBRE offices other than the US use it. "
Deal IQ,"My rating here is based on the transfer of information from DealIQ to our accounting department. Sometimes, even when all of the information is entered correctly it it not effectively communicated upon exporting the information. "
Deal IQ,"There are some areas that can be improved for example, can it save some prefilled areas since we almost always choose the same answers and for the consideration section, it would be nice if I can type in the term and select either month or year and all boxes are prepopulated vs adding one by one.  I wish attachments had a list of everything required to be attached along with the option to add additional documents and the option to override if you know it is not needed.  Lastly, if the 2 required e-mails can already be there and does not need to be manually added each time.  I tried to add it as a team member as a workaround but it wouldn't work.      "
Deal IQ,"- Ability to run historically closed vouchered deals for our assigned brokers so we can analyze trends
- Ability to automatically share all deals with another CSS on the team"
Deal IQ,"1) Deal IQ interface with TransAct needs to happen soon!   
2) Would be wonderful if when you copied a project you could choose which documents you want included with the new project.
  "
Deal IQ,"Yes, we need the ability to see all information.  When invoices are mailed.  What contingencies are listed.  If there are contingencies that keep revenue from being recognized, we need visibility to that for tracking."
Deal IQ,You would have to call me.  I couldnt even start writing it
Deal IQ,"It's unreliable and inaccurate.  My team has 100's of transactions a year, and DealIQ doesn't keep up very well.  I'd say we have 85% confidence in it, which is not nearly acceptable for an accounting piece of software."
Deal IQ,Good tool but there seems to be some inaccuracy in the numbers so I just use it to give a general idea of my revenue production 
Deal IQ,"Dual rep deals should not require 2 separate vouchers; when entering lease commencement & expiration dates, deal IQ should automatically calculate the lease term; we should be able to search/print comps for ourselves without having to ask research for help; we should be able to enter per Sq Ft commission the same way as % commissions; that's it for now - I'm sure there are other things that I have forgotten to add, but this is a good start"
Deal IQ,"I would like to be able to slide/arrange the pipeline columns left or right in an order I like.
thx"
Deal IQ,"Certain autofill functions would be helpful for recurring information about the submitting party.
It would be helpful if the Deal IQ # more closely corresponded to the final invoice # assigned for each input. "
Deal IQ,There is no reason that commission data should be wrong so often.  Timing of payment and what is due/past due is inherently wrong.  I love the platform.  Hate the accuracy.
Deal IQ,"Once uploading the lease, it would be very beneficial if Deal IQ is able to extrapolate the information form the lease agreement. Also, when submitting the information, on a NNN basis, it requires the Operating Expenses, Electrical Cost and Taxes. This info is not always available to us so the information that we have to submit might not be the most reliable. "
Deal IQ,"Several fields required towards the end should be populated automatically given the rent schedule provided to calculate the commissions.  It would also be nice to be able to create a template to use each time, where you can have the same broker team listed and / or client information when working multiple deals with the same client. "
Deal IQ,"you should be able to process portfolio deals, especially if the properties are within the same state, by added multiple address to one voucher. you should also be able to link multiple vouchers together so that you show a complete portfolio sale if the buyer and seller are the same parties using one LOI and one PSA. you should have a place to add the project number used for expenses so that the transaction team can see that information, but not alert every broker on the deal report by adding that information to the notes section. you should be able to upload the splits provided by national partners rather than re entering the list of 40 or so brokers every time there's a minor change to the final purchase $$ of the deal."
Deal IQ,"While not very common, the errors in notifying me about commissions increasing and/or failing to notify me before the payday when those commissions hit my account is incredibly frustrating"
Deal IQ,Data input on several tabs takes longer than needed.  Would be great to have single deal input tab.
Deal IQ,"Loading deals into DealIQ is not easy and feels like an extra step that only helps management make revenue projections, especially when as an Agency broker we often have several proposals going that may/may not ever land. "
Deal IQ,"Like using it but still has quirks that should already have been fixed by now, such as (1) state names (and other drop-down boxes) should pop up when you start typing; (2) agile deals should have a different form or options (for instance, since we typically do not get the SF, that should not be a required field); (3) sometimes contact info disappears after being typed in; (4) the Recent Payments/Recent Installments tabs are confusing; (5) the Business Type/Use ID is different than what comes with the excel voucher etc and have to go thru whole list if you are not sure what category to use; (6) if marked confidential, should not have to complete Comp section; (7) Excel and Deal IQ are at times a penny off and since accounting does not see Deal IQ, you have to make a comment. Also, it is difficult to ask questions of the local accounting team about entering information in Deal IQ when they don't even use the system!  The Deal IQ team is helpful but need accounting at times with voucher nuances.  Accounting cannot see Deal IQ at all! Thanks for your time."
Deal IQ,"putting in begin and end dates of lease term should calculate term automatically

there should be more flexibility in how commission calculations for leases can be entered"
Deal IQ,"Minor annoyances, sometimes Deal IQ is off a penny, but the voucher if you print out as an excel is not off the penny. "
Deal IQ,I find Deal IQ cumbersome and not very intuitive to  use. Everything has to be opened and closed and there is no ability to copy across entries - even with multiple similar entries.  It is just clunky.
Deal IQ,Why do we use SIC codes? Many of the tenants we lease to don't fit into these archaic categories.
Deal IQ,"when invoices are produced, they automatically upload into deal iq."
Deal IQ,"It isn't very user friendly, some areas are very frustrating.  Multiple spots where you have to re-enter information already supplied (financials area, commissions area, comp area, etc.).  I know the older people in my office find it too difficult, so they have their admins upload their vouchers and usually the information is put in incorrectly (Tenant Improvement Allowance, Lease Type - FSG or NNN, etc.) because pooled assistants aren't involved in the deal process so this is all foreign to them.  Then because the older Brokers don't want to use DealIQ/don't understand it they don't actually review the information and just hit ""complete"".  So we end up with incorrect information in our comps system.  Also, DealIQ doesn't talk to our comp system properly even when deals are entered correctly.  Just had one where I included the Tenant Rep Agency & Tenant Rep Name on the comp page, but then MiQ didn't populate any of the information - so I had to give it to research directly.  Constantly having to do things 2-3 times to make sure the systems have the correct information is incredibly frustrating.  This is a cumbersome system from pipeline estimates to vouchering to comps.  "
Deal IQ,please email me at alex.sandoval2@cbre.com. I have some ideas I would love to share on how to improve.
Deal IQ,More details available on older deals.  More details that are exportable for reports.
Deal IQ,would like more training on the platform.
Deal IQ,"Have the option to delete or revise company names and addresses that pop-up when creating a new deal. There are some that are incorrect and then multiple duplicate names and emails on the ""points of contact""."
Deal IQ,"It would be nice to have those little ? button next to different questions with explanations. Like when you use tax software. Either a little pop up window shows up or on the right hand side, under voucher comments you could show a definition.
Also, they ask some questions, like how much is electric. We don't know that. I've never seen that. Also, if it's a new building with no address yet, it would be nice if we could pinpoint it on a map or give lat/long so you knew exactly where it was."
Deal IQ,"The lease comp portion of Deal IQ has ruined our lease comp data base.  Since it is not required to put all the info for a comp into Deal IQ to get a voucher completed, it leads to a lease comp data base it is full of errors or incomplete information."
Deal IQ,Nothing at this time.
Deal IQ,"If there are recurring deals for 1 client, you could add a button that allows certain details for the same client to be auto-filled."
Deal IQ,Please have someone from your team contact me at your earliest convenience.  There are multiple concerns with this platforms.  
Deal IQ,"Allow the ability to delete old or incorrect addresses that auto-populate or pop-up options.
Detect duplicates."
Deal IQ,Make it easier to log in and find vouchers
Deal IQ,Too many pages to click through for an end result. I feel like it could be modified to be shorter and less tabs for a lot of things.
Deal IQ,"Deal IQ is great! However, after Deal IQ voucher processing is a mess.  "
Deal IQ,It's so close to being great.  Some minor tweaks would be super helpful to make it an every day part of my workflow.
Deal IQ,vouchering process needs improvement
Deal IQ,"Connected emails with contacts (for tracking and automation) would be helpful. Also, vetting/flagging prospects across vouchers/spoc list would be incredible helpful. "
Deal IQ,It never works and always changes the totals to accommodate a new deal. 
Deal IQ,Not at the moment
Deal IQ,"If Client Services / Support could see what their brokers see, so that we can help them or answer questions regarding their pipeline, closed deals, or any transactions that were processed by another CS.  

When a deal has been processed by Accounting, can it stay open until all commissions have been paid/received rather than it being closed, which it isn't yet."
Deal IQ,"DealIQ is great for looking up vouchers and tracking commission, but it isn't very good as a crm."
Deal IQ,"There is a large discrepancy between what we book in our vouchers and what shows up in the system. 

Also, sometimes fees are paid in parts and it doesn't update it on the dashboard and counts the whole deal as ""paid.""

We should be able to get all of the information on past deals when clicking on it, the full comp. It doesn't allow me to do this unless I go in and look at the ""files"" where I need to download the excel file. "
Deal IQ,Give us choices for international currency. 
Deal IQ,"I would like to be able to track my pipeline revenue that includes deals that are not yet vouchered, applying the percentage of likelihood of completion."
Deal IQ,"More flexible reporting
Search results that put most recent deal first
When within a deal the search box doesn't function (can't go to deals that come up in search)
See my prior chats for additional suggestions
thanks for asking!"
Deal IQ,ny has different ways we compute concession 
Deal IQ,Keeping accounting information up to date; Any way to synch Salesforce with DealIQ relative to deal activity or at least prospecting? 
Deal IQ,"Deals that haven't been paid, not moved to closed.  Maybe have its own tab for open deals.  "
Deal IQ,Property category should allow you to pick acres. 
Deal IQ,"I can't always trust if my commissions are correct.  They keep going up and down, therefore i don't feel like it is accurate.  However, when it is accurate, I use it multiple times a day."
Deal IQ, 
Deal IQ,it's finicky with comps and cumbersome to get a deal vouchered.  It's hard enough to get a deal done and then it's like the spanish inquisition to get an invoice out...
Deal IQ,If we don't have to fill out fields that don't have the asterisk I just don't get why it's in the system it's a little confusing. Also  where do we find the lease comp info? 
Deal IQ,"One noticeable area where there needs to be an improvement is in the voucher portion. When it comes to selecting when commissions are due, the options vary from ""at lease execution"" to ""at lease commencement"" etc. Well, the issue is when you select either of those two, the system immediately thinks that the fees are due literally on those dates, without accounting for the fact that all landlords take 30 days from those events to pay out the fees. In fact any and all commission agreements say ""...within 30 days of such and such event"". And since we don't process vouchers until deals are signed, it basically immediately puts all deals that show first payment (or the entirety of commission) that's due at lease singing in ""Past Due"" category. Hence creating a false image of where our fee collections are. "
Deal IQ,Update the mobile app so that it's a trusted partner - currently not working or available on mobile...
Deal IQ,The request for early invoice does not seem to work.  It still requires everything to be put into the system and then I get an email from Transactions saying I am missing all of the documentation.
Deal IQ,"Comp information that we include once a transaction is complete being able to be cc'd in a spreadsheet to our research/comp teams.
"
Deal IQ,"The autofill for contact names and info, and the lease calculations page, is glitchy. The autofill, will try and fill in names/contact info before you are done typing. And when you do finish typing and hit Tab, the name will disappear but the contact info will stay. The lease calculations/commissions page is not consistent. If you change any of the numbers it will recalculate most of the time, however it glitches and will generate a voucher that is incorrect. This part is inconsistent, so you never really know when it will happen, but the fact that you have to recheck DIQ's work is time consuming."
Deal IQ,SPOCs not always up to date.
Deal IQ,Figure out the rounding issue between Deal IQ and the downloaded Excel sheet. They are often off by 1¢- requiring notes/emails back and and forth to TA.
Deal IQ,Identifying the Buyer and Seller contacts are not very intuitive on some of the screens when vouchering.
Deal IQ,"It would be great to have a way to remove previous lease consideration from the consideration total AND the commission without having to add an extra line in that throws off the term. Most people do not want to see previous lease consideration removed from JUST the commission - they want an accurate term, accurate consideration AND accurate commission. "
Deal IQ,The financials tab could use drag and drop options in order to move around rents.
Deal IQ,"It would be helpful if the Support Person could see their broker's Dashboard so that we could help them track commissions. Also, a deal shouldn't be moved to closed until it has been fully paid, and the deal is closed, not just when Accounting has issued an invoice."
Deal IQ,There are always discrepancies in commission. The voucher process is very tedious and could be streamlined 
Deal IQ,There are not enough data validations in place and data entry is clunky and laborious. 
Deal IQ,"provide ability to (i) sort by deal type (office, retail) and (ii) show addresses on map."
Deal IQ,e
Deal IQ,"Gross and Net total commissions to the broker fluctuates constantly.  Our team (7 partners) see these numbers change all the time, including going down.  I can't see any scenario where broker gross/net should go down.  The system is absolutely unreliable and causes far more angst than help.  Hopefully it can be fixed in 2024 to be somewhat accurate. "
Deal IQ,allowing a line or area to enter for expense or marketing reimbursements (As per the listing agreement)
Deal IQ,"1. auto calc the effective
2. automatically move info in to comps
3. be able to download calcs to spreadsheet that is not the voucher so we can share numbers to other team members or outside brokers"
Deal IQ,"In the main search feature at the top of every screen, be able to search for a deal by the Deal Report #. Currently only able to search by Deal Report number from the Projects search bar."
Deal IQ,"I wish there was a way to make a ""template"" for buildings for Landlord deals.  It would be a huge time saver if building, client and billing information was all pulled over automatically for each building rather than entering them each time. I know that you can copy deals but not all of the information pulls over every time you copy the deal and some information you may not want to pull over does as well.  "
Deal IQ,"The section for ""commission per sq ft"" should be changed. A lot of brokers are '$$ x SF x Year'. Often times you have to change the adjust the amount to get the total correct. That causes it to look like the amount being charged is incorrect."
Deal IQ,"There seem to be glitches. Some items will auto-populate, some won't. You type in the info and it won't stay, so you get an error and have to go back and re-type it in. "
Deal IQ,A lot of repetitive info if it is a dual rep deal
Deal IQ,"It looks user-friendly, but these are the few tasks I would like to accomplish with intuitive 1-2 clicks:

- Past due invoices
- List of invoices not yet paid but not past due
- List of YTD paid invoices
"
Deal IQ,"In the consideration section, there needs to be a dropdown menu for OPEX as some landlords pay commission on OPEX.  As it is designed now, we have to lump Base Rent and OPEX together when outlining the consideration."
Deal IQ,"It would be great to more easily export closed deal data, particularly around past due commissions to see gross to CBRE amounts and points of contact which are critical in follow up for collections, and also for year to date stats which are more complicated for multi-producer teams like mine! "
Deal IQ,For me it took a lot of 1-1 training to learn how to use DealIQ but now that I understand it I see that it is a powerful tool.
Deal IQ,I would love to be able to see when an outside broker has been paid and the check info.  I also would like to be able to adjust information on the Pipeline Report for each deal rather than going into the deal itself to modify.
Deal IQ,"the application is improving, however, outages and challenges with searching deals seems to continue.  In addition, data sometimes does not appear to be up to date or real time."
Deal IQ,We should be able to pull invoices once they are ceated and due from inside DealIQ.
Deal IQ,It would be nice if different software communicated to each other. 
Deal IQ,"It never seems to be updated properly.  The business categories are ridiculous.  There isn't a category for financial advisors, but there is for something as uncommon as goat farmer (not exact example)?!?!"
Deal IQ,It would be great if there were a way to generate a draft voucher prior to sending; that would facilitate sending a voucher for review by the broker(s).
Deal IQ,"I rated Deal IQ ""Somewhat Easy"" to use because there are STILL many quirks/tweaks that I have requested to be fixed over the years that would definitely make it really easy/faster to use!  I'll name a few: (1) When you start typing a state, it should jump to that section of the list and start giving you matching options; (2) There should be a delegate option for brokers who want/need their support staff to access their Deal IQ (I know there is a collaboration option but that does not work for my team) - I was told this was likely being added at some point but nothing to date :(; (3) The business type/user ID section does not match what is on the Excel version of the voucher and you have to scroll thru that long list several times if you are not sure which is the best match! Need easier way to handle that; (4) There should be special/different options for agile deals (for example, they do not have square footage information); (5) Sometimes there is a rounding error on the Excel version compared to Deal IQ, so you have to add a comment because accounting does not see the Deal IQ version!; (6) It is difficult to ask questions of the local accounting team about how to enter certain information in Deal IQ when they don't even use the system! The Deal IQ support team itself is very helpful but sometimes need accounting's assistance with voucher nuances in Deal IQ.  Accounting cannot see into Deal IQ at all! AND many clerical mistakes are occurring because accounting has to re-enter the information into MTA that I already took the time to enter into Deal IQ…that does not make sense to me! I find errors on most of deal reports...mainly minor but errors nonetheless and extra time I have to spend ensuring the report is accurate and contacting accounting if it needs correction! Thanks for your kind consideration in addressing any of these issues :)"
Deal IQ,"When in pipeline view, the forward/backward arrows to not facilitate through the records in order.  A remedy for this issue would expedite updating records."
Deal IQ,it does not seem accurate & i can't understand why accounting wont send past due invoices proactively instead of me having to constantly request them. 
Deal IQ,"There should be the ability to add properties into DealIQ when you're a Landlord Broker so that you don't have to type the same address for every single voucher - you would just have the ability to select the property and it should auto load all information (Landlord name, address, point of contact, as well as property address for the Premises).  It seems like there was an intention for this to happen based on some items in DealIQ, but hasn't come to fruition.  
Certain fields in vouchering should auto-populate - such as, if I'm entering the monthly rent to determine the commission amount, the starting monthly rent should be able to populate itself on the comp page.  We should never have to enter the same information twice, but we do. "
Deal IQ,"It would be great if information input, transferred into the comps section such as the outside broker info.
Could use a box that calculates the effective rent.
The ability to upload an excel calc sheet or even download a calc sheet from the information input.  "
Deal IQ,"I really like the whole all concept, but the program is not as Intuitive as I would like it. some of the drop downs are not clear of in it is in house or out of house questions and Unclear if information is saved.  it would be great if there was a video tutorial which took on through a deal start to finish. "
Deal IQ,"Way too many inputs required.  It asks for zip codes like 4 or 5 times and that seems unnecessary.  Since we need to send all vouchers to finopsvouchersnewyork@cbre.com, that email address should automatically pop up instead of having to look up the exact address each time.  Also, when we have to enter what type of business the tenant is, those choice are totally outdated.  There's no ""financial services"" option.  All the options are way too specific and too many of them."
Deal IQ,Need to be able to see more as a Client Services Specialist. Also being able to voucher international would be very helpful. Ways to convert currancy. 
Deal IQ,"When submitting lease vouchers, additional inputs should be added to make the process easier. Often times, brokers are required to input opex and real estate tax $'s and in NYC, they are somewhat unknown in future lease years. We are required to attach OFAC reports, perhaps a link to the CBRE log-in would be helpful. "
Deal IQ,An update training for the 10 most asked questions and or ono on one training say 20 to work through reports and comments on deals. 
Deal IQ,"I don't know if this is because of Deal IQ or my browser and how it auto saves some text, but sometimes when I'm filling out contact info, it doesn't save it when I progress forward or it will delete some lines but not others (like it keeps the email and phone number, but the name will disappear)"
Deal IQ,Deal IQ makes the process of creating an invoice extremely painful.  There is so such required info that is not relevant.  Its not clear what is being asked in every section.  Its time consuming.  It can't be a catch all for every department.  It doesnt work.  The most important email whicjh is local accouting is not even in the dropdown
Deal IQ,Frequently not properly updated.  And the end of year numbers never are posted correctly before the new year starts and new year numbers post.  
Deal IQ,it would be helpful if we could submit prospects on it & if the Voucher system was simplified. 
Deal IQ,Greater flexibility with reports / filters.
Deal IQ,For deals there should be a category for land so you can skip a number of useless tabs
Deal IQ,"A mapping feature would be great--if when I add an address to a prospect, if I could then pull up a map and see pins showing all of my prospects in an area"
Deal IQ,"Deal IQ could be great.  However, I track my gross and net revenue and it is rarely accurate.  I have brought this up many times and i always receive an answer that is absolutely ridiculous.  Additionally, i have caught issues with deals sliding off the platform, deals that were underpaid and poorly noted.  Overall, the fixes to the program are easy, yet, they never happen.  Deal IQ could be wonderful, if it were accurate and didn't make mistakes.  
 "
Deal IQ,"Make the commission per sq ft section easier. Should be 4 columns ""commission per sq ft"", ""quantity/sq ft"", ""years/months"" and ""amount"""
Deal IQ,"It would be helpful if I also received notice when payments are received / right now the brokers get emails about it, but they don't let me know, just makes it more difficult to track what's been paid.  We all see a notification when a deal is added, can we also be notified in Deal IQ when a deal is paid/ receive a notification?  Thank you."
Deal IQ,"Not at the moment, but thank you for asking.  If something does come up, I will let you all know. "
Deal IQ,"Couple of thoughts:
1. On the commission page if there is an OSB and we have already plugged in the firm/broker info on the financials portion it used to auto populate those fields. Bringing that back would be beneficial

2. Being able to store property information such as address, landlord, po#'s and bill to info would be a huge help. Having to go in and add all of that info every time we do a deal is time consuming"
Deal IQ,"I dont understand why i have to add in the accounting team in order to process a voucher.
Also - it needs an internal tracking process when the voucher gets created, then invoiced, then check send and by who and when CB/broker follows up then a notifcation once its been received."
Deal IQ,My payments on Deal IQ don't always match up with my traunch report. I don't like that it gives me credit for production on payments that have not been made. It seems it could be much simpler.  
Deal IQ,"Make the State field able to accept the first letter, i.e. type ""A"" 3 times until to you get to Arizona so you don't have to take your hand off the keyboard."
Deal IQ,Usability is getting worse.  
Deal IQ,"There are a lot of fields that are required that don't apply to deals I'm vouchering. There are also issues reporting in our pipeline any vouchers that have installments, it doesn't pull the full amount and only the first installment. "
Deal IQ,"In the sort box in the CLOSED DEALS section, it would he helpful to be able to sort by ""gross commission"" amount. Often FinOps or TA will ask us if a commission check received belongs to us, but since there's no easy way to sort by gross commission I end up clicking through each deal to find a match to the check amount. (I realize you can download a report but that takes longer)"
Deal IQ,Mimic Realnex
Deal IQ,"On completed vouchers, it would be nice if the Deal Report could be attached after processing.  "
Deal IQ,"1. Make Deal Report numbers in larger font.
2. Have more info from MTA in Deal IQ
For example, show dates that invoices are issued for Installments. Have supporting information on write-off amounts.
3. Have a system check to ensure Total Commission Amount on the Commission Tab equals the sum of the payments. If an installment amount changes, the Total Commission Amount does not automatically update."
Deal IQ,I would love to have the app running as well as the web version. 
Deal IQ,"Allow to copy images directly from an email and drop into DIQ file section
Allow to use different fonts, sizes & colors, in the notes section
Incorporate CBRE prospect & dealsheet online directly in the DIQ platform
"
Deal IQ,"Yes! 
I started at CBRE when Deal IQ was being rolled out and have been a devoted user.. 
It's still a bit clunky. It's not super intuitive.. 
it doesn't look ""attractive"" on my mobile device  - in fact I can't even see most of the data if I'm on my phone - and it's challenging to see all of our information at once most of the time. 
The Dashboard is excellent and works really well - and I wonder why we can't have a similar interface with the commissions due/ payments and notes on ongoing projects.. 

It has ALL of the most important information about my work in one place and it is the place I go to ten times or more a week ... but it isn't gratifying to use. 
Yes , it's great when I see that 'My commission has gone up , but its harder than it needs to be to put in each project... 
but thank you so much for all you've done on this and are doing... it's a wonderful tool and I use it daily ..

Deal IQ,Would be nice if City/state auto populate when Zip code entered
Deal IQ,Just keep communicating if there are any updating issues we need to be aware of.
Deal IQ,Fields should match MTA instead of missing important items.
Deal IQ,please turn text that has been corrected from V1 to V2 RED
Deal IQ,"Inclusion in pipeline should be the default.

Deal IQ,"-Remove SF requirement for vacant land

Deal IQ,It is hard to navigate and not user friendly. It doesn't  show all the details and the caculations are not always accurate
Deal IQ,It can sometimes be cumbersome.
Deal IQ,System in not intuitive and seems like more of a puzzle than a tool. Need to be able to talk to someone for assistance rather than email back and forth when an issue arrises.
Deal IQ,"the support people are excellent, however the system is NEVER updated and we are not informed as to why after information and deals are submitted, they are not reflected in the system."
Deal IQ,"If another field can be generated to enter multiple addresses for Porfolio properties, that would be most welcomed. "
Deal IQ,"It would be great if we could manually add deals to track (essentially to track future revenue), where we could input notes, deal stage (LOI, Lease, Sale, etc), add team members, add projected commission amounts, probability, etc 

"
Deal IQ,It would be great if it was modified to also become a CRM solution.
Deal IQ,The DealIQ team is always available for questions and quick to respond. 
Deal IQ,Stop making people have to SAVE changes.  Its a redundant step
Deal IQ,"Admins should have access to past deals in order to process vouchers, they always have to ask for contact info again. "
Deal IQ,"Wish CS's for teams could see more of the financial side like that of the brokers.

Also making this more friendly for billing to other countries. Very cumbersome to bill other countries and different currencies. "
Deal IQ,"Deal IQ itself is good, but somehow the research analysts get incomplete comps and if it could just export out of Deal IQ it would save them time tracking down missing info, and improve our comp database tremendously. "
Deal IQ,"Let me drag documents- sometimes is easier than uploading them. Allow me to rename them too. I'd like to be able to re-arrange the rents as well. sometimes we accidently skip a row, or need to add free rent at the top. Also, it is really difficult to search for the * Business Type / Use ID - the window is too small - maybe allow for expansion. Can you add one section for NNNs? other than the comments? Thanks!"
Deal IQ,I realize this isn't Deal IQ's problem but having information on what is actually revenue to CBRE (vs. cash in) would be helpful for people who need to track that for their group (COE)
Deal IQ,"Autofill for contacts on the Landlord/Seller, and Tenant/Buyer, only partially works. If you start typing in a name, it may or may not fill some cells while erasing info in other cells."
Deal IQ,It would be nice that the calculations actually show in formulas when exporting the voucher as brokers wish to see the math.  Also that the calculations sum are the same as we get on a separate excel sheet instead of having to adjust 
Deal IQ,Loving the new mobile app!!
Deal IQ,Would love to set up a zoom and discuss how me and my partner Nick Moran and I utilize and how we would love to see it improved to make it seamless for us!
Deal IQ,"Include a drop down to select if it is a sublease, instead of a small check yes or no. Be able to do an extension and expansion all in one without having to do two vouchers. Correct the rounding for the rent schedule and comps. "
Deal IQ,Not being able to access closed deal or final documents can be an issue at times.
Deal IQ,Wish we could drag documents into the site as well instead of just uploading them. Ability to re-name docs; a BOX for NNNs; move around the rent considerations - sometimes there is free rent and need to go on top. and more
Deal IQ,Having access to move commission lines up and down instead of retyping the whole calculation again.
Deal IQ,"I think adding a Landlord/Tenant section for tracking inquiries would be helpful as well as a sale/lease section as well. Would love to hop on a zoom call to touch base on this in more detail. I have a bunch of ideas.

Deal IQ,Make it easier to talk to human when problems arise.  Exchanging emails is a slow and somewhat imprecise way to solve issues.
Deal IQ,"the ""likely to recommend"" question is unhelpful, because it's a required system. there's no recommendation to use or not use, simply the obligation to use. "
Deal IQ,It was better before.  Too inconsistent and underfunded these days it seems.  Also should not be rekeying vouchers in once we have input in deal iq.  What's the point?
Deal IQ,Allow dual agency deals to populate on the same voucher.

Deal IQ,"Make it easier to have access to our brokers' deals we're not added to. If a broker is added to a deal, it would be helpful if his/her client services professional AUTOMATICALLY had access to that deal.

Deal IQ,It can be glitchy when you add billing information to a voucher. This applies when the bill to information is Other. You enter the address and then it disappears every time. You must always retype it. That gets old but otherwise it works well.
Deal IQ,"I really like Deal IQ but it still has quirks that should already have been fixed by now, such as the following: should be able to enter the 1st letter for a state and keep clicking that letter until you reach the correct state (have to scroll down list); the Business Type/Use ID should have a pop out that you can look at - sometimes I have to scroll thru the list a few times to find the correct one (waste of time) AND it should be the same list that is available with the Excel version of the vouchers!!; enter contact info and sometimes all or part of it disappears after being entered; should have a completely different form for Agile deals; need a way to review the excel voucher before ALL info is entered (we USED to be able to do that) etc etc.  Also, it is difficult to ask questions of the local accounting team about entering information in Deal IQ when they don't even use the system!  The Deal IQ support team itself is very helpful but sometimes need accounting's assistance with voucher nuances in Deal IQ.  Accounting cannot see into Deal IQ at all! AND many clerical mistakes occur because accounting has to re-enter the information into MTA that I already took the time to enter into Deal IQ…that does not make sense to me! Thanks for the opportunity to provide comments."
