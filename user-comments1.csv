"Users are locked out frequently requiring assistance in e-mailing service desk for unlocks and submitting new passwords, etc. Then, due to the changes in passwords, they are likely to lock themselves out again. I understand this is largely an ""end-user"" issue, but it is a recurring issue at many sites. Perhaps lowering the threshold for the password would be helpful. A 4-digit pin is easier and more manageable for technicians than intricate password requirements (which inevitably are written down in a handy location so they can remember it thus defeating any security provided by an intricate password).  Streamlining the password / unlock request process. Is it necessary to have to contact support? Could this process not be automated using the technicians e-mail or other two factor authentication? This would eliminate the requirement to e-mail or call support. And theoretically (and I hate to sound like an MBA) but could cut costs for the service center or allow them to refocus their efforts to solving other issues.  Better access to associated PMs and WOs associated with assets and generated PM work orders. For me to look at the past PMs for a monthly generated work order, I have to go to the relevant WO, click on the equipment tab, click the equipment number, click on order history, then organize by date to find the older work orders. This is not intuitive, and with the limited access frontline supervisors and managers have to search, reports, and equipment detail, it is not feasible to search assets and draw relevant information, history, etc.  On-site supervisors and manager don't have adequate control over PM generation and Asset management meaning we have to submit asset changes to our SI7 manager to make relevant changes. This is time consuming and takes the control from the individuals with the knowledge need to be inserted and creating an unnecessary middle step to the process.  Last, if there was a way in which work orders could be generated real-time on a monitor, it could be incredibly helpful. For our sites that used used TMS CMMS system, when a work order was generated it would automatically print the order on the shop printer and we would immediately know that a WO had come in. It also gave us a physical copy to hand to technicians for them to read the relevant details, complete the assigned task, then enter the completion info into CMMS. A similar system, printed or perhaps displayed on a monitor in work areas would allow such real-time acknowledgment of entered orders. ",Feature Request/ Enhancement

Quantum is a huge consumer of time. CNET cert is a 3 year cert but being forced to take every 6 months. It is a technician cert. yet managers ands directors are being forced to take it as well. CNET  is not specialized for each contract and provides information some technicians will never deal with such as the IT portion  of the cert. If CBRE wants to implement CNET it should be as a new hire training not taking technicians away from the daily duties and responsibilities not to complete every six months. ,NA
So much of Quantum is a redundant process for me so it is difficult to be objective. It could be useful if the other processes were no longer in use but that is never the case so it is frustrating.

"Firstly, nobody in management seems to realise what users are saying, SI7 is not fit for purpose!! Things have never worked properly & since the 'upgrade' 2.5 years ago it's been worse. Over half of our jobs disappeared after the change over to SI7. Our guy met with the SI7 rep for 2 days, went through all the problems & nothing was changed or done about them. Task cards are not correct for jobs. You can't add hours or edit after a jobs closed. You can't see other users times that have been booked to a job so can't tell if times overlap. You can't drag & drop jobs in the dashboard any more. Why did you waste time developing JARVIS when it's hardly used & the core basics aren'y running properly? Why is no-one in management willing to step up & get things fixed & working properly?   These are just some of the problems, but no-one listens to the boots on the ground when they're saying thing's need to be fixed for us to do our jobs properly!",Feature Request/ Enhancement

"The thing I dislike the most about fmPilot is when I am putting together a larger quote. I have to pay attention to the time and click save every 5-10 minutes. I have had on multiple occasions where ive put together very large bids taking me over 30+ minutes and when i go to save it will like time out and ill loose everything from my quote and have to start over completely. The next thing i dislike is when I invoice a job, we have to wait for pending verification. Even though i have the invoice completed and submitted. I feel like if our invoice is already done, we shouldnt have to go back in again after verification status is complete, just to change the status again for our invoices submittal. When im done with a job, i invoice it and when the store verifies. That should be it, I shouldn't have to go change status again to submit our invoice. I forget about this all the time and it causes us more days waiting to be paid for our work. Or if we already have a signed work order, why do we have to wait up to 3 more days for the store to verify the work is done? If a Manager signed our work order, isn't that already verifying the works been complete? My last complaint would be when i get a work order with a DNE on it. I go out and look at the job to inspect and verify what all is needed to complete the scope. I dont get a MOD to sign the work order at that time, as i have the intent of doing the job. However, their have been times where i complete an inspection and get back to my office. I run the numbers for labor and material, realize i need a DNE increase and submit a quote. My quote doesnt get approved and i invoice for incurred. Then the invoice gets kicked back because i dont have a signed work order, this has happened at least 5-6 times. I dont think i should have to get a signature on a work order when we dont complete the scope thats detailed on the work order. I also shouldnt have to drive back out to a property for a signature, just for the cost of 1 trip charge. We have had to do this before as well and its more of a pain and takes more time to deal with it then what our trip charge is worth. I think a different way to invoice for our incurred trip charges should be available and they shouldn't require a signed work order either. ",NA

It often results in escalations to a corporate level (several times a month) when they report that they want to use the system but get frustrated with the time spent trying to get it to load correctly.  All are aware to try different browsers to see what works best for them + the recommendation to clear cache/cookies daily to increase performance but it would be nice to be able to eliminate the need for these additional tasks. If there is any opportunity to get this challenge turned around, I think that would eliminate a significant portion (if not all) the frustration the team and client sees with using this system. ",NA
The largest problem is speed. The more we can migrate the executable onto the local PC the faster the whole thing will run.,NA
the latency,NA
The only issue I have consistently is with login to the mobile app.  I usually have to try multiple times to login successfully. ,NA
The only tool I have been trained on is Kahua.  Kahua is extremely slow.  It eats alot of my time in reporting and my staff time in input.   ,NA
"The overall performance is poor the web pages take a long time to load. The controls used in the pages to save, reassign and to make changes are also very slow. ",NA
The site a bit slow to load from section to section. Otherwise it is a great tool to be able to put non emergency problems into.,NA
The speed of the system and onboard RAM needs to be improved and documents like Spend Authority should be integrated into the system.,NA
"The system is clunky, kicks you out often while working and there are areas that definitely could use some updating to make users jobs easier. It often feels very outdated.",NA
The system is often extremely slow when entering or pulling up existing information. It makes interactions w/clients longer and is frustrating when trying to access information.,NA
The system is very slow Also it seems to log out randomly sometimes at last 3 times a day.  When a quick list is run and then you try to do another it logs out ,NA
The tool is incredibly slow,NA
The web page loads too slowly.  Honeywell customers should have a prompt to enter their email instead of Username.,NA
"The website is slow a buggy. As a company we often times have issues submitting quotes. When we are logged out due to inactivity it takes a long time to get logged back in and sometimes when we log back in, our accounts are not listed so we have to log out and log back in again. I'm not a fan.",NA
"There are only issues when the app goes down. The IVR phone line is very unpredictable, sometimes it wont recognize check ins and we need to check in again when we're checking out, thus the time onsite isn't recorded. The app is fanatstic.  ",NA
"Unfortunately, the Platform is very slow and loads slowly, looks like a 20-year-old website. ",NA
Very often Kahua runs very slow.  It is too cumbersome and not friendly for updating multiple projects when you have 100+ projects.,NA
"why can fmPilot not work in all browsers?  Why are some functions not available while using specific browsers?  Trying to find the ""correct"" browsers to use to do my job can be difficult and time consuming for little to no reason.",NA
I would suggest that tools such as Kahua are used by everyone in projects including local delivery teams. As at present we are only using the tool on account I think a larger implementation and rollout would be beneficial ,NA
its pretty much spot on. Not a fault of quantum but i would like to be able to integrate more safety culture docs or shared folders with it. ,NA
"Quantum works for what I need, the only additions perhaps would be to make it more ICT functional. At present it is very FM & ME related.",NA
A centralized project management tool (like Procore) would be great for CBRE. 95% of all project are already using this tool,NA
"Acho um meio de comunica?ß?£o muito ??til na empresa, mas poderia ser melhor utilizado pelos usu?°rios do mesmo. (GT - 
I think it's a very useful means of communication in the company, but it could be better used by its users.)",NA
Overall cohesive and well arranged hovewer sometimes it gets a bit complicated,NA
I have worked for many brands and bar none the Team for FM Pilot is by FAR THE BEST! I am amazed at the very short response time and the professionalism of the teams that respond! Hat's off to your entire team!,NA
It's every thing it should be and more,NA
The platform is very useful for addressing work orders.,NA
Very User Friendly program,NA
" Not to mention the PMs workarounds.  I hope CBRE is working on an updated cloud based SaaS tool that is flexible, and has end users involved in development (from PM, finance, procurement at the minimum) -  I'd love to help. ",NA
 Programs like Estimator & Spacer are great resources and are easy to find. ,NA
"Capital planner, estimator, and other tools I have used are really good, ",NA

Everything looks to be working out fine.,NA
"I think as a landing page, it is quite useful",NA
Its very simple to use and navigate around,NA
Let's quit trying to do a one size fits all solution for project managers and let them use the tools that support their functions and how they work best.,NA
"no realizaria cambios , es muy estable la plataforma , muy amigable nos ayuda en el dia a dia a organizarnos y en especial manera en los cambios de turnos (GT - I would not make changes, the platform is very stable, very friendly, it helps us organize ourselves on a day-to-day basis and especially when changing shifts.)",NA
Overall I find it quite straigh forward to use with no unnecessary frills. ,NA
Overall it is good to have because we can track the WOs which are requested from the Employees as well as can track the PMs for execution & closure on time.,NA
Perfect,NA
Please don't change it!,NA
Quantum is the best application CBRE has. I have only had one issue which was quickly resolved. This makes my job very easy to do. ,NA
"Quantum keeps a summary of information in one place, and that is awesome to have.",NA
ServiceInsight works very well with my account and is very compatible. Very easy to learn and communicate with other subcontractors. ,NA
"Spacer and power BI are great,",NA
Spacer is ok but we instead try to upsell Workplace Strategy who lead on this type of field  ,NA
Thank you for your continuous improvement ,NA
Thanks for servy ,NA
"The only thing I like on the platform is PowerBI, Plans and PDA",NA
"the tools seem great, and an asset that we could take advantage of, however it is not easy to find anything.",NA
Why fix it if it isn't broken ,NA
works well as far as I know.,NA
"I'm not sure how it started, but Smartsheet started hosting Webinars for CBRE employees.    Super helpful but also a need way for employees to see what is out there amongst the tools we're using.    If something similar could take place with Power BI where individuals using that software could be brought together to be taught basics and advanced things I think that would be beneficial to CBRE as a whole. ",NA
  Alternative software like Monday.com is more user friendly from a delivery aspect and enables users to assign actions to users/owners. ,NA
  We should be using Procore to manage projects and store all documentation.  Thank you,NA
" These high tech clients are used to building top tier softwares and apps overnight, so not being able to make changes to the interface makes the tool lose credibility.",NA
 We mainly use MS Project and MS office tools.,NA
"In former companies i found easier ways, to administrate project both economy and documentation.  Programs like, Dalux witch can we can send to our FM departments and they will have the maintenance timeschedule, just from receive a file, garanties and more. without working, Therefor i recommend that ""we"" in projects use tools that produce value for the entire company, with minimum cost.",NA
Our project insight tool was much more PJM user and leadership reporting friendly.   Our previous tool I could run a report in seconds on any field I wanted. ,NA
Very inefficient to tools compared to our competitors. ,NA
"We have also recreated tools and software that were already working perfectly well (ie schedule management vs Microsoft Project, budget management vs Excel, project charter vs Word, etc.).  ",NA
My clients have been sending their requests to the iopropertyservices@cbre.com email address in order to get a work order number.  I understand it takes 24 hours but lately it has been taking a couple days for a simple access card request.  Can you make the emails that clients/tenants use to sent requests consistent?  A lot of clients/tenants still use the phone number and email for work order requests instead of the PSL website and are not willing to use the website because they've been using phone number and email method for 15+ years,Feature Request/ Enhancement

"The system could have local support, able to serve each market and training materials translated into several languages â€‹â€‹for use by the managers of each contract, in addition, new users when registering do not automatically receive a password as already done in the past. thanks.",NA
Needs to be a better way to directly contact someone regarding outstanding work tickets ,NA
"When trying to contact someone via email through the portal it is takes forever to get a response, if at all. There needs to be better contact information for getting a hold of a responsible party for questions. ",NA
Been trying to get a facility added to me for over 4 months. Have been approved on my end but is still not on my company profile. Need IT help that users can call instead of constantly having to call CBRE for them to send e-mail to IT but  IT never calls back to help.,NA
You need to improve FsElite Connect BIG TIME...because we have problems clocking in and getting into the app...IT IS SUCH A BIG HEADACHE!,NA
Most of the time it makes me sign in more than once.,NA
1. The system needs to be able to be non 'helpdesk' capable,NA
Calling the IVR system makes getting crews clocked in / out quite difficult as the system does not allow enough time to get the web # entered and ends the call.  ,NA

"I have access issues.  After a particular company onboarded, I am only able to access 1 of the two accounts.  If I get into 1, the other is locked out,  Even though the credentials are different for each account.",NA
Over a week to reset a password. Very Upsetting and disappointing with SUPPORT I getting. The same support I got when your system went drop for over a month earlier this year. ,NA
"Pricing is locked in and we do different levels of work that require different pricing. The Estimate to invoice transfer doesn't work most of the time. If you upload an invoice it doesn't recognize it even when we have already added the invoice number where asked, it tells you to upload it again - redundant waste of time. Things sometimes just disappear and then we are forced to do it all over again - wasted time. I am sure there are a few more quirks that I do not remember.",NA
"SIRequest bug reporting system not working. Even though we are supposed to launch it from July.   We have a test group at the client's. I receive information from the client that they can't submit a request or log in, I get login errors that we don't know what they mean. I've been getting a different error every time since last week and I can't complete the request every time.

Sometimes Quantum shows saving errors when you are creating or modifying shift handover.,NA
The aapp app keep crashing. ,NA
"Update equipment on the work orders when we submit them. Way too many glitches in this system, wont save information on 1st try. Have to re enter and try to save over and over until system finally retains info. ",NA
CBRE has not trained and/or provided accessibility to all tools available to utilize for my day-to-day work responsibilities. I recommend CBRE create a PM platform/tutorial that demos all tools available and allows PM decide which one to pick and train on to help benefit them/their team to perform more efficiently. ,NA
"Firstly, I don't know what tools are available for project managers. ",NA
Provide more detail and training on access and tools available in the portal.  This tool is not widely known about.,NA
"Sorry, I need to use this portal to have an opinion and share improvement  I'm allocated inside the client and I use the Workfront tool to keep the projects updated.",NA
Never had proper training on how to use it I've had to fumble through it on my own. Parts but I do not like once I look up a work order when I try to go back I got to re-submit everything for a particular building when I'm trying to do a site history,NA
SI7 is difficult to navigate thru it does not use standard wildcard nor was it developed with the end user in mind the training provided is subpar at best and LOGCHECK is better!,NA
"The Request Dashboard is a good service in submitting work to be completed, however if the Matrix is not setup properly this can lead to work orders going to companies that are not in my state. I would like to see the name of the company along side the Primary/Secondary matrix in the dispatching tool. Because this does not exist, I have to use the Main Portal to reassign the job to the correct vendor.",NA
I do not feel the CMMS Manager who reports to me receives an appropriate level of support from our ServiceInsight platform.  My primary concern is the manner in which ServiceInsight tickets are managed.  I would be happy to discuss this further with anyone who would be willing to hear that feedback.,NA

I think if you had some training videos that will show us how to navigate through the site that would be perfect.  ,NA
In the first instance it would be great to receive some introductory training for all of the tools which would create awareness and enable initial use of them followed by more in depth use as suited and needed.,NA
Introductory training and better communication on what the programs do and how they can help PJM.,NA
It is advised to organise focused training sessions on these tools. I have not seen one organised for any of these tools as yet. ,NA
It would be good to have training on each of the available tools. Not sure if this is already available through Talent Coach.,NA

We have had one training day on Teams with Ms. Frenetta Tate.  I, along with several others of my team, have had little class training time on this app.  I probably could be doing something in an easier fashion if I only knew the system better.

Needs to be a bit more training. It's not very efficient to search for work orders when you have to restart search criteria every time you leave current list. It is also hard to give accurate start and completion times if the work order already comes in past due. Need to be able to edit completion times so vendors can receive more accurate score grades. ,NA

I don't think it's functional.",Feature Request/ Enhancement
SI7 is used at a number of company sites globally - my understanding is we have a universal template that must work for all sites.

The auto 3-6 monthly un-enrollment of my technicians unless i respond to an email is ridiculous. Please link employment of my technicians with Quantum so that i dont need to confirm they still work for me every 3 months.

I will say, like with anything, the more time invested using the app the easier its become to manage. This is in direct response to the difficulty of SI7.   The app doesn't populate everything that is requested. I often have to hit refresh on the browser when i bring up my call list because it doesn't bring up all of my WOs. I've entered a CAS to create a PO and the PO doesn't generate in coupa. Just things like that would help if they were cleaned up. Maybe streamline the app better. Make a GUI for each level of clearance as far as access to the app. So a tech's GUI would look different than an FM/FC. Not just making the links inaccessible. ",NA

There is room on the screen for larger boxes, so you can see all of the details in the PM job boxes that display the PM jobs without having to scroll a half inch, but this room isn't utilized. Also, when checking the Cycle Statuses in the PM jobs, only the work order(s) for one cycle show in the data results list below, even if more than one cycle ran for the time frame indicated - you have to use a drop down for the Cycle Instance field to see all of the cycles that ran during the time frame. It would be very helpful to see ALL work orders that ran during the time frame indicated/selected. ",NA
"Allow me to open and notate multiple work orders simultaneously. Currently, fmPilot will only allow you to notate the work order that was opened last. fmPilot is also often slow and buggy.

Dumping 120 workorders and only being able to navigate by target date, building site, or when the work order was produced is redundant. I use the tool ""building"" to look at all the work orders on that site but wish it would further breakdown to ""Fire LIfe Safety"" tabbing or highlight  in various colors to depict which work order needs attention first or have the ability to make those changes as a user. The limitations of the mobile app are as useful as looking at a click and look webpage. I would love it to be more interactive.",NA
More flexibility could be given to the project managers when creating the PDA The documents produced could be less generic,NA
"Most of the extended search features don't come in handy.  Would be helpful if we could just search by Store name or Location #.  Currently, we have to know the CBRE client code and whether there are zeros in front of the location # to search.  The WO# search feature is helpful but sometimes we don't have that # so the store name would be helpful. Would be helpful if there were 2 columns of work orders, one showing the default that is visible now and then one for the in progress work orders.",NA
"My comments are specific to Kahua. We've created a platform that we didn't ask for, and doesn't address a real need. ",NA
"Navigation is brutal.  Toggling back a screen is awful and you have to start completely over again.  Ex: Site history - list populates - dive into WO, back out and have to re-enter parameters again, instead of going to the previous screen",NA
Needs a more advanced and integrated search feature/system. This program is convoluted and cumbersome to navigate through. Nothing about the program is anywhere intuitive,NA
Needs a UX overhaul badly. This is not intuitive for a general employee NOT involved in facilities.  ,NA
None of these features on the Kahua platform have made us better or more efficient.  The opposite is true.,NA
Not all of the approvers are available on the PDA dropdown menu,NA
Not make the page so busy. Less is more,NA
Not very intuitive for picking correct categories,NA
"Now that I'm used to it, it is somewhat easy to use. It was somewhat hard to learn, and I still learn new tricks and features all the time. I NEED it to do my job. It has been pretty solid lately, not crashing or locking up. For a while there, I was copying every longer comment, just  in case it decided to give me an error message.",NA
"Open WOs in seperate tabs of browser (chrome, edge) will save a lot of time. ",NA
"Oui, mettre en fran?ßais et que le Quantum soit plus intuitif. (GT - Yes, put it in French and make Quantum more intuitive.)

our tools should be easy-to-use at the point there is no need to explain how they work. ,NA
"PDA is very clunky and time consuming to use, doesn't provide any assistance as a project management tool and as a global tool ",NA
PDA tool is complex ,NA

Putting up the financial information - if that could be made easier / more fluid; that would help.,NA
Remove the additional OK buttons and be allowed to conduct multiple tasks within the same frame or screen ,NA
"Scrap it and start over.  Model Service Channel.  FMPilot is clumsy, especially with building a quote.  Also, service provider should be able to submit a quote/RFP without needing to wait for a work order from the client.   This is one of the worst client websites available.",NA
Search for work orders needs to be narrowed down.,NA
"Seems like the program hasn't been updated since the 90's, it looks very old and not user-friendly",NA
"self generating work orders are over complicated being that you have to put your information in several times instead of a quick problem/ solution work order with labor time.

ServiceInsight is a great tool for collecting information and seemingly for dispatching work and tracking open tasks.  The system seems a bit cumbersome when trying to look for specific work order/PM's because of the limited screen layout. ,NA
SI could be more user-friendly in part of asset database changes - bulk modifications etc,NA
SI7 needs to be more user friendly. It takes a lot of steps to get to where you need to go. If you can lessen the steps to say get to reports or PM'S to adjust it would be easier. ,NA
Simplify the usability of the platform,NA
"Simplify the work order to invoice and propose. too many steps. We work with SMS assist, and it is easy compared to yours. Has all work orders, tabs for communication, pictures, invoice and proposal on each.",NA
So far very easy to navigate no issues ,NA
"Some of the modules could link better into each other, also you need to look at the Job Roles and what they can see.",NA
"Some of the sub-categories are not obvious, such as ""other services"", etc. when trying to find the issue you're trying to address.  Meeting room set-up should be easy to find, etc.",NA
somehow making history searches easier.,NA
"Specific to the PDA tool having gone through the training and guidance documents, it was still very nuanced on how to fill in all the data.  ",NA
streamline updates by removing the need to choose what company to update and just making them use a universal system/code so you can get in and out,NA
"takes time to open and navigate through and WOs, assigning WOs need to be done individually which sometime it is time consuming need some flexibility especially in search tools, it is not user friendly when need to look for assets and PMs ",NA
The bid tool in Kahua needs a considerable amount of work to be useful to our team. ,NA
The CBRE tools and system are inadequate for small and medium Mech services projects. ,NA
"The feedback/ survey email needs to be changed - I think, we should be creative to ask for feedback messages by changing the font and make it short and easy to read",NA
"The IMFM format works better for entering work orders, but lacks the flexibility and control that SI7 has in the desktop format",NA
The interface can use some improvement.  The design looks dated.  ,NA
The jobs I am project manager for are not set up to use the above tools ,NA
The navigation of the portal is less than adequate. Searching for open work orders is not easy. You should add e-mail verification once a work order is submitted. ,NA
The notes function and the actual recorded history of the work order is confusing and folks often look in the wrong place! ,NA
"The PDA tool seems to be poorly enforced, and did not keep up to speed with the life cycle of my project",NA
The preventive maintenance is not friendly. Also is needed in local language and with local job plans and frequencies.,NA
The system is less intuitive than other WO systems I have used in the past.,NA
"The systems are too cumbersome, ",NA
"The work description is limited to 2048, which is very short to explain the issues, describe the steps, and set a recommendation.",NA
"There are a good amount of general usability problems such as the ""View Service Request"" functionality and your ability to easily identify status changes/updates to your open work orders.",NA
There are a lot of restrictions in SI that make it a difficult program to self-serve in and to customize to improve the customer experience. Navigational functionality steps do not make the user experience efficient. I have a list if interested. 256-990-9087,NA
There are certain functions with the system that I wish were a little easier. ,NA
"There needs to be an easier way to run reports in FMP. The way to set up filters, etc. is not intuitive, is cumbersome to users, very complicated and frustrating.  Also, the only convenient way to search for a work order is with a PO/WEB number. If I'm doing a search and do not have that criterion, I'm dead in the water.  ",NA
they are not geared towards project management.  ,NA
they are not user designed and would benefit from a design review. ,NA
"Tickets can be difficult to find, especially when they have been closed.  ",NA
To open  a sub PM is too complicated. As well I face often issues by dispatching date of a work order. which is marked in the past and then too late to close properly the PM (wiht a smily green face for success) ,NA
Tool customized on principal project works,NA
"UI overhaul focus on lessening the amount of ""Clicks"" required to achieve an outcome.",NA
"Using the tool once it is up and running is not what I am dissatisfied about. The dissatisfaction comes in the transparency of the IT team on what it will take to customize for each account, the minimal support that is received to customize the platform, and the time it takes (6 months or more in some cases) to get the platform where it needs to be. ",NA
"we as managers use the FM pilot and desktop version, the App is a different set up. I would like to see a way to access the app better for managers to see what the techs see to help make sure clients and info can be accessed better. The downloads and uploaded forms are not visible to the field techs. ",NA
"We love it, it makes our job from check in to invoicing very easy.",NA
We need management tools that gather data efficiently and comparatively not just used as a data dump Kahua ,NA
We need to produce tools that make the individual more efficient whereas we insist on rolling out tools for the manager where nobody can see the benefit,NA
When I try to look up vendor work orders it doesn't give me what I need,NA
"Work order location defaults to the wrong location than mine every work order.  Too many clicks and menues to create a work order.  do not get updates to my email when wos are approved, finished cancelled put on hold etc.  dont know who gets my WO,  very difficult to search for work orders I have created, no easy way to follow up on work orders unless you write down work orders and check on them manually..  Techs do not have the same work order numbers as I create when they do their work.  ",NA
"would be great if i could receive email notifications each time an employee opens a ticket for us. without emails, i have to refresh the page all the time just to make sure we don't have anything pending",NA

Need a dull time person just to keep up with this system ,NA
needs improvement to navigate easily. ,NA

Not too sure what's ServiceInsight is. Was not introduce to the team.,NA
"Not too user friendly yet, I have Steve Klecker to help me out a lot.",NA
"Not written by a user and therefore user friendly. Does not direclty account for different langauages. Not coherent or joined up and too much duplication. Roles are generic and do not align with the roles and functions of the people using it on the account. Software updates keep wiping out previous entries, therefore demoralising teams and creating extra work for them through no fault of their own. ",NA
Quantum is easy to use but the constant development makes it frustrating as a tool when things are moved or features added that affect its historical use. better training and documentation for these changes would be better,NA
