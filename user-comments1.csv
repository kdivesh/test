"Users are locked out frequently requiring assistance in e-mailing service desk for unlocks and submitting new passwords, etc. Then, due to the changes in passwords, they are likely to lock themselves out again. I understand this is largely an ""end-user"" issue, but it is a recurring issue at many sites. Perhaps lowering the threshold for the password would be helpful. A 4-digit pin is easier and more manot applicablegeable for technicians than intricate password requirements (which inevitably are written down in a handy location so they can remember it thus defeating any security provided by an intricate password).

This would eliminot applicablete the requirement to e-mail or call support. And theoretically (and I hate to sound like an MBA) but could cut costs for the service center or allow them to refocus their efforts to solving other issues.  Better access to associated PMs and WOs associated with assets and generated PM work orders. For me to look at the past PMs for a monthly generated work order, I have to go to the relevant WO, click on the equipment tab, click the equipment number, click on order history, then organize by date to find the older work orders. This is not intuitive, and with the limited access frontline supervisors and manot applicablegers have to search, reports, and equipment detail, it is not feasible to search assets and draw relevant information, history, etc.  On-site supervisors and manot applicableger don't have adequate control over PM generation and Asset manot applicablegement meaning we have to submit asset changes to our SI7 manot applicableger to make relevant changes. This is time consuming and takes the control from the individuals with the knowledge need to be inserted and creating an unnecessary middle step to the process.  Last, if there was a way in which work orders could be generated real-time on a monitor, it could be incredibly helpful. For our sites that used used TMS CMMS system, when a work order was generated it would automatically print the order on the shop printer and we would immediately know that a WO had come in. It also gave us a physical copy to hand to technicians for them to read the relevant details, complete the assigned task, then enter the completion info into CMMS. A similar system, printed or perhaps displayed on a monitor in work areas would allow such real-time acknowledgment of entered orders. ",Feature Request/ Enhancement

Quantum is a huge consumer of time. CNET cert is a 3 year cert but being forced to take every 6 months.

SI7 and Coupa need to be integrated. Once a WO is dispatched to a vendor the WO is basically useless and becomes a record.

Over half of our jobs disappeared after the change over to SI7. Our guy met with the SI7 rep for 2 days, went through all the problems & nothing was changed or done about them. Task cards are not correct for jobs. You can't add hours or edit after a jobs closed. You can't see other users times that have been booked to a job so can't tell if times overlap. You can't drag & drop jobs in the dashboard any more. Why did you waste time developing JARVIS when it's hardly used & the core basics aren'y running properly? Why is no-one in manot applicablegement willing to step up & get things fixed & working properly?   These are just some of the problems, but no-one listens to the boots on the ground when they're saying thing's need to be fixed for us to do our jobs properly!",Feature Request/ Enhancement

I have had on multiple occasions where ive put together very large bids taking me over 30+ minutes and when i go to save it will like time out and ill loose everything from my quote and have to start over completely. The next thing i dislike is when I invoice a job, we have to wait for pending verification. Even though i have the invoice completed and submitted. I feel like if our invoice is already done, we shouldnt have to go back in again after verification status is complete, just to change the status again for our invoices submittal. When im done with a job, i invoice it and when the store verifies. That should be it, I shouldn't have to go change status again to submit our invoice. I forget about this all the time and it causes us more days waiting to be paid for our work. Or if we already have a signed work order, why do we have to wait up to 3 more days for the store to verify the work is done? If a Manot applicableger signed our work order, isn't that already verifying the works been complete? My last complaint would be when i get a work order with a DNE on it. I go out and look at the job to inspect and verify what all is needed to complete the scope. I dont get a MOD to sign the work order at that time, as i have the intent of doing the job. However, their have been times where i complete an inspection and get back to my office. I run the numbers for labor and material, realize i need a DNE increase and submit a quote. My quote doesnt get approved and i invoice for incurred. Then the invoice gets kicked back because i dont have a signed work order, this has happened at least 5-6 times. I dont think i should have to get a signot applicableture on a work order when we dont complete the scope thats detailed on the work order. I also shouldnt have to drive back out to a property for a signot applicableture, just for the cost of 1 trip charge. We have had to do this before as well and its more of a pain and takes more time to deal with it then what our trip charge is worth. I think a different way to invoice for our incurred trip charges should be available and they shouldn't require a signed work order either. ",not applicable

It would be better to just time out completely and return to the log in screen if it can't stay actively running, so at least you don't falsely believe your info is active and correct when it's not.

"The largest challenge with utilizing fmP2 is the latency and/or system crashes - it is frequent enough (several times a week) that it impacts productivity and performance for myself, my team, and our client. It often results in escalations to a corporate level (several times a month) when they report that they want to use the system but get frustrated with the time spent trying to get it to load correctly.  All are aware to try different browsers to see what works best for them + the recommendation to clear cache/cookies daily to increase performance but it would be nice to be able to eliminot applicablete the need for these additionot applicablel tasks.

I'm still good with the interface but could have some improvements with the correct trade match from client-side to IFM to avoid rework.,not applicable
"Improved access availability, escalation of approvals, reduce number of clicks required to view backup information, improve wo status review and improve dashboarding.  Improve vendor onboarding and payment reconciliation. ",not applicable
"In comparison to NVS's tool, SI7 is complicated, overpopulated with options (for office needs) and visually overcrowded. ",not applicable
"It is difficult to track work request.  It would be better with without the need for ""like"" or ""%"".",not applicable
"It is easy to use once you get used to where everything is at.  The overall site appears a bit outdated, but its features have improved since we started using FM Pilot.    ",not applicable
"IT IS ONE OF THE EASIEST, MOST USER FRIENDLY FORMATS OUT THERE",not applicable
It needs to be more user friendly,not applicable
"It needs to be more user friendly for users with more than one location. Maybe an option for the calendar to have location added so we can view only WO's for that location, or have the WO numbers showing on the dates without having to click on them to open them. All vendors need to update WO's quicker. ",not applicable
It required several iterations before being able to submit for approval properly,not applicable
It shouldn't take 22 steps to create a work order.,not applicable
It would be awesome if when creating a work order if it could be completed on one screen.  When I have to create a work order with a quote there are too many steps involved.  It seems that every time that you not applicablevigate from one screen to the next you have to wait.,not applicable
"It would be better if they were all very visible on the intranet and easy to access -  in my previous firm this type of thing would have been on a Tools section on the homepage of the intranet, so if we could do that I would definitely use it more. ",not applicable
It would be great if PPG did not have to receive POs through Kahua exclusively.  ,not applicable

Kahua Bid tool is not seamless or easy to use,not applicable
Kahua could be made simpler to use.,not applicable
"Kahua I can access from my desktop so the only thing I like on the platform is PowerBI, Plans and PDA",not applicable
Kahua is not friedly at the beginning but now it help me keep projects on track,not applicable
Kahua is not the best option for the functions we are using it for.  ,not applicable
Kahua is super difficult ,not applicable
Kahua is the main data manot applicablegement tool we have and it is not designed for Principal work.  ,not applicable
Kahua is the most difficult to use. ,not applicable
Kahua needs a better scheduling tool.,not applicable
keep the app working better and it is much easier than desktop version,not applicable
"less clicks and menues to create a work order,  not default to location that I am not at, send push emails on status and when work orders are complete.  Too time consuming to schedule a work order and follow up on the status of it.",not applicable
"Logging jobs on PDA adds no value whatsoever to our day to day role of pricing, and/or delivering projects. ",not applicable
looks like a website from 2002. needs to make updated status more streamlined as well as adding attachments and updating. ,not applicable
"make is easier to put invoices in, be able to log in from the workorder online",not applicable
Make it easier to attach attachments to a work order/request,not applicable

"Many of the tools listed (spacer, plans pro, office ready, program manot applicablegement, etc.) are not actually technology tools used by our PJM teams. ",not applicable
MFM  needs a total overhall. ,not applicable
"Mobile ServiceInsight needs to be more file and folder hierarchy. Dumping 120 workorders and only being able to not applicablevigate by target date, building site, or when the work order was produced is redundant. I use the tool ""building"" to look at all the work orders on that site but wish it would further breakdown to ""Fire LIfe Safety"" tabbing or highlight  in various colors to depict which work order needs attention first or have the ability to make those changes as a user. The limitations of the mobile app are as useful as looking at a click and look webpage. I would love it to be more interactive.",not applicable
More flexibility could be given to the project manot applicablegers when creating the PDA The documents produced could be less generic,not applicable
"Most of the extended search features don't come in handy.  Would be helpful if we could just search by Store not applicableme or Location #.  Currently, we have to know the CBRE client code and whether there are zeros in front of the location # to search.  The WO# search feature is helpful but sometimes we don't have that # so the store not applicableme would be helpful. Would be helpful if there were 2 columns of work orders, one showing the default that is visible now and then one for the in progress work orders.",not applicable
"My comments are specific to Kahua. We've created a platform that we didn't ask for, and doesn't address a real need. ",not applicable

Needs a more advanced and integrated search feature/system. This program is convoluted and cumbersome to not applicablevigate through. Nothing about the program is anywhere intuitive,not applicable

Not make the page so busy. Less is more,not applicable
Not very intuitive for picking correct categories,not applicable
"Now that I'm used to it, it is somewhat easy to use. It was somewhat hard to learn, and I still learn new tricks and features all the time. I NEED it to do my job. It has been pretty solid lately, not crashing or locking up. For a while there, I was copying every longer comment, just  in case it decided to give me an error message.",not applicable
"Open WOs in seperate tabs of browser (chrome, edge) will save a lot of time. ",not applicable
"Oui, mettre en fran?ßais et que le Quantum soit plus intuitif. (GT - Yes, put it in French and make Quantum more intuitive.)

PDA tool is complex ,not applicable

"Scrap it and start over.  Model Service Channel.  FMPilot is clumsy, especially with building a quote.  Also, service provider should be able to submit a quote/RFP without needing to wait for a work order from the client.   This is one of the worst client websites available.",not applicable
Search for work orders needs to be not applicablerrowed down.,not applicable
"Seems like the program hasn't been updated since the 90's, it looks very old and not user-friendly",not applicable
"self generating work orders are over complicated being that you have to put your information in several times instead of a quick problem/ solution work order with labor time.

ServiceInsight is a great tool for collecting information and seemingly for dispatching work and tracking open tasks.  The system seems a bit cumbersome when trying to look for specific work order/PM's because of the limited screen layout. ,not applicable
SI could be more user-friendly in part of asset database changes - bulk modifications etc,not applicable
SI7 needs to be more user friendly. It takes a lot of steps to get to where you need to go. If you can lessen the steps to say get to reports or PM'S to adjust it would be easier. ,not applicable
Simplify the usability of the platform,not applicable
"Simplify the work order to invoice and propose. too many steps. We work with SMS assist, and it is easy compared to yours. Has all work orders, tabs for communication, pictures, invoice and proposal on each.",not applicable

"Some of the modules could link better into each other, also you need to look at the Job Roles and what they can see.",not applicable

"The IMFM format works better for entering work orders, but lacks the flexibility and control that SI7 has in the desktop format",not applicable
The interface can use some improvement.  The design looks dated.  ,not applicable
The jobs I am project manot applicableger for are not set up to use the above tools ,not applicable
The not applicablevigation of the portal is less than adequate. Searching for open work orders is not easy. You should add e-mail verification once a work order is submitted. ,not applicable

There are a lot of restrictions in SI that make it a difficult program to self-serve in and to customize to improve the customer experience. not applicablevigationot applicablel functionot applicablelity steps do not make the user experience efficient. I have a list if interested. 256-990-9087,not applicable
There are certain functions with the system that I wish were a little easier. ,not applicable
"There needs to be an easier way to run reports in FMP. The way to set up filters, etc. is not intuitive, is cumbersome to users, very complicated and frustrating.  Also, the only convenient way to search for a work order is with a PO/WEB number. If I'm doing a search and do not have that criterion, I'm dead in the water.  ",not applicable
they are not geared towards project manot applicablegement.  ,not applicable
they are not user designed and would benefit from a design review. ,not applicable
"Tickets can be difficult to find, especially when they have been closed.  ",not applicable
To open  a sub PM is too complicated. As well I face often issues by dispatching date of a work order. which is marked in the past and then too late to close properly the PM (wiht a smily green face for success) ,not applicable
Tool customized on principal project works,not applicable
"UI overhaul focus on lessening the amount of ""Clicks"" required to achieve an outcome.",not applicable
"Using the tool once it is up and running is not what I am dissatisfied about. The dissatisfaction comes in the transparency of the IT team on what it will take to customize for each account, the minimal support that is received to customize the platform, and the time it takes (6 months or more in some cases) to get the platform where it needs to be. ",not applicable
"we as manot applicablegers use the FM pilot and desktop version, the App is a different set up.

"Not too user friendly yet, I have Steve Klecker to help me out a lot.",not applicable
"Not written by a user and therefore user friendly. Does not direclty account for different langauages. Not coherent or joined up and too much duplication. Roles are generic and do not align with the roles and functions of the people using it on the account. Software updates keep wiping out previous entries, therefore demoralising teams and creating extra work for them through no fault of their own. ",not applicable
