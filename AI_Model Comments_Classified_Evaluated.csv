"The thing I dislike the most about fmPilot is when I am putting together a larger quote. I have to pay attention to the time and click save every 5-10 minutes. I have had on multiple occasions where ive put together very large bids taking me over 30+ minutes and when i go to save it will like time out and ill loose everything from my quote and have to start over completely. The next thing i dislike is when I invoice a job, we have to wait for pending verification. Even though i have the invoice completed and submitted. I feel like if our invoice is already done, we shouldnt have to go back in again after verification status is complete, just to change the status again for our invoices submittal. When im done with a job, i invoice it and when the store verifies. That should be it, I shouldn't have to go change status again to submit our invoice. I forget about this all the time and it causes us more days waiting to be paid for our work. Or if we already have a signed work order, why do we have to wait up to 3 more days for the store to verify the work is done? If a Manager signed our work order, isn't that already verifying the works been complete? My last complaint would be when i get a work order with a DNE on it. I go out and look at the job to inspect and verify what all is needed to complete the scope. I dont get a MOD to sign the work order at that time, as i have the intent of doing the job. However, their have been times where i complete an inspection and get back to my office. I run the numbers for labor and material, realize i need a DNE increase and submit a quote. My quote doesnt get approved and i invoice for incurred. Then the invoice gets kicked back because i dont have a signed work order, this has happened at least 5-6 times. I dont think i should have to get a signature on a work order when we dont complete the scope thats detailed on the work order. I also shouldnt have to drive back out to a property for a signature, just for the cost of 1 trip charge. We have had to do this before as well and its more of a pain and takes more time to deal with it then what our trip charge is worth. I think a different way to invoice for our incurred trip charges should be available and they shouldn't require a signed work order either.

We have about 500 buildings in Site IQ. If we only used Site IQ for everything, that wouldn't be too hard. However, we use Dimension and other tools, too.

"I receive purchase orders and process invoices in over 60 different sites for hundreds of customers and regarding invoice submission, this is my least favorite. I literally do not understand why it is so complicated and segmented to submit invoice in fmPilot. Invoice submission should be simple with an uncomplicated setup and platform. This should include easy access to each field, previous invoices, and should not be separated in small blocks without even a full screen (why is the screen a small square in my screen?) There should be an obvious field for invoice submission, & for the Invoice Number, and amounts. I mean to create an invoice you select ""submit invoice"", so how do you submit the invoice once it has been created? I submit each invoice at least 4 times.... You have to search for each field and good luck getting back the next time. Try separating the dispatch/work from the final invoice submission. Two different departments perform the functions at almost all companies but fmPilot acts as if it is one function, one process, and one department handling it all. Please try again and see other platforms first.",Doesn't Meet Client Needs

If i take 20-30 minutes detailing a quote and including every single material with model numbers and etc. It then takes me 20-30 minutes having to copy my quote word for word in order to submit my invoice.

"Users are locked out frequently requiring assistance in e-mailing service desk for unlocks and submitting new passwords, etc. Then, due to the changes in passwords, they are likely to lock themselves out again. I understand this is largely an ""end-user"" issue, but it is a recurring issue at many sites. Perhaps lowering the threshold for the password would be helpful. A 4-digit pin is easier and more manageable for technicians than intricate password requirements (which inevitably are written down in a handy location so they can remember it thus defeating any security provided by an intricate password).  Streamlining the password / unlock request process. Is it necessary to have to contact support? Could this process not be automated using the technicians e-mail or other two factor authentication? This would eliminate the requirement to e-mail or call support. And theoretically (and I hate to sound like an MBA) but could cut costs for the service center or allow them to refocus their efforts to solving other issues.  Better access to associated PMs and WOs associated with assets and generated PM work orders. For me to look at the past PMs for a monthly generated work order, I have to go to the relevant WO, click on the equipment tab, click the equipment number, click on order history, then organize by date to find the older work orders. This is not intuitive, and with the limited access frontline supervisors and managers have to search, reports, and equipment detail, it is not feasible to search assets and draw relevant information, history, etc.  On-site supervisors and manager don't have adequate control over PM generation and Asset management meaning we have to submit asset changes to our SI7 manager to make relevant changes. This is time consuming and takes the control from the individuals with the knowledge need to be inserted and creating an unnecessary middle step to the process.  Last, if there was a way in which work orders could be generated real-time on a monitor, it could be incredibly helpful. For our sites that used used TMS CMMS system, when a work order was generated it would automatically print the order on the shop printer and we would immediately know that a WO had come in. It also gave us a physical copy to hand to technicians for them to read the relevant details, complete the assigned task, then enter the completion info into CMMS.

"Definitively we need the tool and it does much of our daily job.  

My feedback is that:

1. The tool needs a major upgrade with many and new modern features that graphics and colors that may please the user's eye.
2. The page looks too cluttered with too many options on a single page.  
3. People who spend a lot of time on this tool end up with visual fatigue, interest is lost and it does not make the user want to spend more time using the tool.
4. It is hard to make a search of a single WO and we end doing many steps to find a WO
5. My team is mostly on the field and less time on the desk computer.  They need a friendly user app to create WO, good catches and more important, the get notifications before the WO expires, whenever there is a new WO or a rush WO.  They all stop using the app, since for every instant they exit the app and seconds later return back to it, they have to log in again and again.  It should have face recognition or finger recognition. 
6. The tool minimize our productivity, since it needs a considerable amount of time for all; Example: more than 18 minutes to create a single WO.  We cannot create PM, this is manage by other, but waiting for others kills our productivity time.  The options to create a WO by its category is complicated to choose, not easy to classify and disorganized at the human eye
7.The client's portal is complicated too and my clients is now using other alternatives to the WO's since they cannot classify the categories well due to lack of common options
8. the graphics are hard to understand, they should be easy to understand at first view, but instead a deep interpretation is needed
The log in at the desk computer is now difficulty, since the computer does not memorize the password and we have to write down the password every time.
9. Whenever I download a report, the report does not record the assignee name if the assignee is one of my technician.  I simply don't know who completed the action.","Usability Issue, Access/Availability Issue"

"Yes, I have lots of comments, and you may not like them. When I joined CBRE on the Yahoo account, they were using something called Intrepid. It was garbage and they upgraded to SI7, which I help beta test for the account. It's not much better. Facts, SI7 is at least a decade behind industry needs and requirements. The mobile app has never worked. Asset Management is adequate. The CM and PM ticketing is cumbersome. It is very difficult to create a weekly PM schedule. There is NO material management or inventory control ability. Condition assesment is barely there. Bottom line is, I should be able to issue my tech a PM work order, a warehouse, or tool stores person, recieves the same order, kits all the pieces and parts for the PM and the tech picks it up, goes off to the roof and performs the PM, none of this, I forgot a filter or a belt. Maximum efficiency of wrench time needs to be applied here. Also the tech should be able to input the condition of the equipment his is working on. Identify any issues he finds that need to have a corrective work order, create said work order on the spot, and the both are connected as parent and child. SI7, does have a parent/child relationship, but the tech has to do all of this at his desk top. People forget things, photos don't get attached etc. Before I came to CBRE I was working at a national labratory in Livermore CA. We were using Maximo in connection with Tririga. Out of the box the system did almost everything we needed. That was in 2012, when I left. Here we are in 2024, and SI7 isn't even close to what we need in the industry. My suggestion to you is to take a hard look at what is working out there. AND, if CBRE is so insistant on keeping SI7, because we own it. Then you need to move it in the direction where it is competitve and compariable with what is on the market. Right now, CBRE is failing to provide my techs with an adequate CMMS tool in order to perform their jobs and help meet our KPI's. ",Doesn't Meet Client Needs

"Tons of comments/questions/suggestions for DealIQ! I'll try to be brief. 

- UX/UI needs tons of improvement, along with the process flow. 

- I'm confused about the full purpose and functionality of DealIQ in regards to how the retail team is using it. From what I understand, DealIQ is primarily an accounting tool used to support the brokerage with accounting transactions, projections, commissions, etc. The disconnect is that we are also trying to use the system as a CRM and relying on it for our sales pipeline, which does not work. 

- EX: Entering all the contact information and details when first setting up an asset. If the system is serving as a CRM then I would want to include information such as contacts, marketing strategy, requirements, budgets and commissions. However, when proceeding to voucher the ""business leads"" into actual commissioned deals, there are situations, where it's necessary to use system work-arounds to complete the voucher, even when those workarounds compromise the integrity of the data being entered and don't necessarily make sense from a sales/marketing /data standpoint. 

--Example: Should be able to enter 0% for an outside broker that is not getting paid directly by CBRE. It does not make sense to later have to go back and delete the outside broker completely from the deal just to proceed. I would suggest adding a check box or drop down on the outside broker commissions page that can later be checked if CBRE is not paying that commission. That way, the system can leave outside broker commissions off of the final voucher if it's not necessary for accounting purposes.  The outside broker is still a part of the deal, even if we are not paying them directly. It doesn't make sense to manually enter extra data for research purposes when even basic information/data is not being entered and documented accurately. 

- As a CRM, the system, process flow and best practices, that are currently in place are limited and do not provide enough functionality. 

- Retail brokers are not entering pipeline information. The system is not user friendly and lacks functionality, which is why many of the retail brokers refuse to use the system properly or take full advantage of the features available.
 
- Difficult to manage and keep up with access, delegation and updating for user/group privileges and different asset types. 

-Could use more clearly defined best practices, controls and overall process for setting up deals and individual/team access to it, in order to avoid duplicates and user dependence on system administrators. 

-Could use additional fields for secondary contacts as well as the option to add additional contacts for each individual - cell phone and office phone - work email and personal email. 

	- Lack of integration with other systems creates tons of inefficiencies. APIs could be DealIQs best friend!!! APIs are needed, especially if the system is not going to be improved to serve as a CRM or to help manage/track various assets, clients, prospects and the sales pipeline.  
	
	- Need the ability to independently pull detailed reports on assets. 
	
	- Calendar integration would be great
	
	- Campaign Logic Integration would be great! 
	
	- Incorporating the new agreements process within DealIQ should be a priority. It's literally a duplicate process that is all already entered into DealIQ and could be tracked and managed in the system for better efficiency. 
	
	- Silly to limit the characters in a document title to 64 in order to upload it. It's a minor annoyance but it is one more extra steps to go back into computer files, change the name of the file and then re-upload. Additionally, changing the name of the file creates issues when the broker later tried to search for the file that they originally created. 
	
The purpose of tech is to help streamline operations for faster/better  results. Adding more systems and more points of entry only adds more work for the brokerage team and additional manual entry provides greater opportunities for mistakes and human error. There are APIs and Indexing systems that could assist with these tasks , while also saving the company time and overhead costs.

"For retail specifically....after adding the available spaces to a property (ex. a shopping center), it would be great to be able to have each space accounted for individually in the pipeline instead of total square footage of the shopping center.

This would help with pipeline management and eliminate the need for duplication of properties or recalculating total square footage so that the pipeline is current. 

As far as the interface goes, it would be helpful to have the Deal ID# show with all of the other deal information in the Prospecting and Executing stages.

There is no way to tell what the true status of the commission payment is, although there are fields indicating that it might. Still have to email accounting (outside of system) to figure out the status of anything going on - when check is received, dispersed, etc. or why anything might be delayed. No record of history or what is going on, unless you do extra work to copy/paste or make extra notes outside of the email threads with accounting. Communication should be happening within the system and notification emails should accompany that. The system needs more functionality, workflow and ease of use if it is ever going to be fully adopted and actually helpful.  The sales pipeline is pulled from this system, which can't be very accurate because the brokers don't use the system as a CRM and there is no true way to track leads and all the detail needed.

3) When you hit ""submit"", have it be a spinning circle so we know it submitted.  Sometimes it doesn't seem like it so we end up hitting it again creating extra unnecessary voucher versions.

I'll name a few: (1) When you start typing a state, it should jump to that section of the list and start giving you matching options; (2) There should be a delegate option for brokers who want/need their support staff to access their Deal IQ (I know there is a collaboration option but that does not work for my team) - I was told this was likely being added at some point but nothing to date :(; (3) The business type/user ID section does not match what is on the Excel version of the voucher and you have to scroll thru that long list several times if you are not sure which is the best match! Need easier way to handle that; (4) There should be special/different options for agile deals (for example, they do not have square footage information); (5) Sometimes there is a rounding error on the Excel version compared to Deal IQ, so you have to add a comment because accounting does not see the Deal IQ version!; (6) It is difficult to ask questions of the local accounting team about how to enter certain information in Deal IQ when they don't even use the system! The Deal IQ support team itself is very helpful but sometimes need accounting's assistance with voucher nuances in Deal IQ.  Accounting cannot see into Deal IQ at all! AND many clerical mistakes are occurring because accounting has to re-enter the information into MTA that I already took the time to enter into Deal IQ…that does not make sense to me! I find errors on most of deal reports...mainly minor but errors nonetheless and extra time I have to spend ensuring the report is accurate and contacting accounting if it needs correction!

"There should be the ability to add properties into DealIQ when you're a Landlord Broker so that you don't have to type the same address for every single voucher - you would just have the ability to select the property and it should auto load all information (Landlord name, address, point of contact, as well as property address for the Premises).  It seems like there was an intention for this to happen based on some items in DealIQ, but hasn't come to fruition.  
Certain fields in vouchering should auto-populate - such as, if I'm entering the monthly rent to determine the commission amount, the starting monthly rent should be able to populate itself on the comp page.

I raise requests and they get closed and I'm told a new request on a different system needed to be raised (and that the job wasn't closed to simply beat target failures).,Data Issue

There are a number of elements that can improve quantum as a former engineer and now a technical leader. Firstly the incident reporting once completed on the quantum form needs to be able to transfer onto a presentable pdf format which should be auto generated and auto sent to CBRE Management to review and docu sign (to ensure engineers who have scripted errors have been rectified) as verifiers to initiate authorisation for it to be sent over to the client proxy.,Doesn't Meet Client Needs
"The second would be the use of the shift handovers, if they can be also be formalised in a similar formats for being reviewed and sent to client in a simplified format as above. ","Doesn't Meet Client Needs,Business Process Needs to Change"
It would also be good if other applications can be merged into this for the critical walk arounds which occur at the start and end of every shift. These walks highlight issues and if these issues are flagged and auto risk rated and auto drop onto the risk register and action register and even sometimes incident register should anything alarming be found.,"Doesn't Meet Client Needs,Business Process Needs to Change"
The final for me is o&m repository if this can be allocated on a platform for quantum allowing to drop files this will allow engineers to have a one stop go when remotely working on equipment to be able to find a some manufacturer details on the plant equipment. This will definitely take quantum usage to another level. ,Doesn't Meet Client Needs
"From being heavily involved in quantum the nag is clear, its admin heavy in comparison to the output to benefit the engineers. Once the engineering team see a shift in this wave. Once quantum is more beneficial for the engineers on there day to day correctly amalgamated with their day to day work effort automating the admin steps then the usage will take up further. However until then quantum is not quite there yet and is more of a chase to keep up dated in a race against being called out by the global leaders for low compliance or low scores. Therefore quantum needs us more then we need it, once we implement the changes we will need quantum and quantum will get its updates regularly.","Doesn't Meet Client Needs,Technical Issue"
"Whilst Quantum has lots of CERM processes where compliance warrants a YES/NO answer - it doesn't register how well the compliance is.

I do not have a supervisor on site my Contract support is still coming to terms with a new finance and reactive/PPM system. It means it is down to me to try and establish the system as the primary operational tool. I need support to get the system to where it needs to be, and when I am trying to roll it out to the site engineers I have no better knowledge to get the system up to date than anyone else. They ask questions and I don't know, it just makes me look incompetent. The client still has reservations around putting data into it that they would like to remain private.  I am more than sure that it offers a far wider benefits and feel it needs a lot of focus.

So much of Quantum is a redundant process for me so it is difficult to be objective. It could be useful if the other processes were no longer in use but that is never the case so it is frustrating.

I feel the expectations on risk commentary and closure needs to be adjusted to allow for capital planning cycles on the client side ... having to update a risk within 45 days for a risk that could take a year or more to remediate due to capital funding and equipment lead times is counter-productive because it makes the teams not want to enter risks due to the administrative burden.,Business Process Needs to Change
I also feel there needs to be better visibility to CDCP training and status.  Having to go to different systems to see status makes it difficult for a manager to track.,Business Process Needs to Change

Quantum is a huge consumer of time. CNET cert is a 3 year cert but being forced to take every 6 months. It is a technician cert. yet managers ands directors are being forced to take it as well. CNET  is not specialized for each contract and provides information some technicians will never deal with such as the IT portion  of the cert.

kahua is time consuming and clunky. ,Feature Request/Enhancement
"Using the tool once it is up and running is not what I am dissatisfied about.

",Feature Request/Enhancement
"My comments are specific to Kahua. We've created a platform that we didn't ask for, and doesn't address a real need. ",Feature Request/Enhancement
Kahua is a very cumbersome stool for our account. It is generally disliked by the entire PJM population on our team,Feature Request/Enhancement
The largest problem is speed. The more we can migrate the executable onto the local PC the faster the whole thing will run.,Feature Request/Enhancement
I primarily use Kahua - the only complaint I have besides ease of access ,Feature Request/Enhancement
"Regarding Kahua: CBRE has had to create many tools (Smartsheets, BI, Vantage) just to ""work around"" Kahua for reporting, tracking, data visibility etc. This is strong evidence  that Kahua is a weak point in productivity and capability. ",Feature Request/Enhancement
Very often Kahua runs very slow.  It is too cumbersome and not friendly for updating multiple projects when you have 100+ projects.,Feature Request/Enhancement
"Kahua is not intuitive at all, but it can be learned.  it is very slow, it opens slow, loads slow, saves slow, I would appreciate a more flexible, faster system that maybe didn't have as many unused features. ",Feature Request/Enhancement
The tool is incredibly slow,Feature Request/Enhancement
Kahua is often sluggish and I find myself waiting for several minutes at times for items to populate or process.,Feature Request/Enhancement
Kahua needs a better scheduling tool.,Feature Request/Enhancement
Kahua load times can be slow. Not everyone is familiar with how to pull reports from dashboards. Frequently ask for PDF versions of things that can be created from Kahua easily. ,Feature Request/Enhancement
"I've been a part of the CBRE GWS team for a little over a month. During this time, I've found Kahua to not be extremely user friendly. My feedback so far includes lack of efficiency and how many clicks/steps are needed to get through workflows. It's almost like a Russian doll where you really need to dig into pages and steps to get to where you need. ",Feature Request/Enhancement
I would suggest that tools such as Kahua are used by everyone in projects including local delivery teams. As at present we are only using the tool on account I think a larger implementation and rollout would be beneficial ,Feature Request/Enhancement
It would be great if PPG did not have to receive POs through Kahua exclusively.  ,Feature Request/Enhancement
"It is time consuming and is not local. It is not possible to cover all local needs and processes with one global unflexible tool. It is nice to have if you have few projects, but if you have many in your portfolio, it is unfortunately not helpful.",Feature Request/Enhancement
Kahua is the main data management tool we have and it is not designed for Principal work.  ,Feature Request/Enhancement
Kahua is not friedly at the beginning but now it help me keep projects on track,Feature Request/Enhancement
Kahua's user interface and functionality increase time burden to the process rather than providing efficiencies. ,Feature Request/Enhancement
"Kahua is too cumbersome and we should consider a ""lighter"" tool for smaller project activity. ",Feature Request/Enhancement
"An increase to the project manager user profile in allowing us to utilize all the functions within Kahua would be a massive help. We currently cannot use bid room, ",Feature Request/Enhancement
"Ensure the tools, especially Kahua, make our jobs easier not harder",Feature Request/Enhancement
"Kahua has a lot of capabilities, but it has a lot of latency issues. ",Feature Request/Enhancement
How Kahua is currently configured and deployed does not make it a usable tool for the delivery of projects.  ,Feature Request/Enhancement
"Also, it's not flexible with our clients changing and differing approaches to document control and updates. ",Feature Request/Enhancement
the schedules are not as useful as Microsoft Project and the schedules are not exportable in Kahua,Feature Request/Enhancement
 Kahua has horrible dashboards.  PJMs need better dashboards to truly financially manage their projects.  ,Feature Request/Enhancement
"Utilization is so difficult that many processes are done outside of Kahua, because instead of being a ""tool"" to make the jobs of Project Managers easier. ",Feature Request/Enhancement
 It is so glitchy and cumbersome that attempting to use it creates extra work.,Feature Request/Enhancement
"  In my case, every time we shared the tool with Intuit, the client did not enjoy the experience. The interface feels old and takes too long to load. ",Feature Request/Enhancement
" These high tech clients are used to building top tier softwares and apps overnight, so not being able to make changes to the interface makes the tool lose credibility.",Feature Request/Enhancement
 Kahua is an absolute joke and regularly a waste of time. ,Feature Request/Enhancement
Kahua was not helpful at all - I just used it as a tick box exercise.  ,Feature Request/Enhancement
" provide custom dashboard and reporting capabilities (current dashboard functionality is very limited and provides no use on this account) - provide means for PM to see all their projects in one view regardless of partition, and provide means to update key data from that same view without having to navigate to a separate app.  ",Feature Request/Enhancement
"  Kahua is the primary Project Management tool I have used since joining CBRE last year. I have found Kahua to be a difficult tool to use. It is not intuitive, there are too many clicks to get from one app to another,",Feature Request/Enhancement
" it is limited in its ability to allow mass updates to key data in one view, ",Feature Request/Enhancement
"The tool typically is slow to respond, especially when using the web version (but even with desktop version...for clarity we are not allowed to download the desktop version on our client laptops). ",Feature Request/Enhancement
" the ""reports"" that are available are typically only data/excel extracts. ",Feature Request/Enhancement
Combine the number of clicks required in various apps to update project data with the slow responsiveness of the tool and we end up with a group of frustrated PMs that struggle to keep up with their project updates and reporting expectations. ,Feature Request/Enhancement
"With regards to the user permissions, I feel Kahua Champions or on account Technology owners should have more autonomy over the day to day management. Raising tickets is time consuming and delays processes.  ",Feature Request/Enhancement
This also goes for Kahua as the information is meant to be integrated. ,Feature Request/Enhancement
" It took a while to set up each project and manage each project from the program, especially when you have 10, 20, or even 30 IPM projects at the same time.",Feature Request/Enhancement

"I'd love to help. There is a lot of manpower being paid, on every single account, to recreate workarounds to make up for Kahua's system limitations. Call me.",Feature Request/Enhancement
We have to create work arounds for most of our processes to make the system work as a PJM data record and mainly as an accounting record ,Feature Request/Enhancement
Best recommendation is to find a tool that accomodates accounting processes and provides a viable PJM recording tool so the work is not manual by record which is currently the state,Feature Request/Enhancement

PDA tool is complex ,Feature Request/Enhancement
More flexibility could be given to the project managers when creating the PDA The documents produced could be less generic,Feature Request/Enhancement
I don't like in the PDA that you have to click on a second screen to see the details of the project. The top screen doesn't even show you the total costs or the detail of the project.  Also once you click on the details it is hard to find your way back to the approver screen. Hitting the back button doesn't go there you have to go back to the home screen and click on the project again to approve it.  I haven't used Kahua in a couple of years as a user so can't comment on the software or recent upgrades.,Feature Request/Enhancement
Tool customized on principal project works,Feature Request/Enhancement
Not all of the approvers are available on the PDA dropdown menu,Feature Request/Enhancement

"Every project starts empty, there is no memory or saving possiblilty  to start with account settings.",Feature Request/Enhancement
"The PDA tool seems to be poorly enforced, and did not keep up to speed with the life cycle of my project",Feature Request/Enhancement
Yes. The PDA tool is inadequately populated with PJM associates. Current PJM employees auto predict the PM's and LMA leaders in the Basic Project Information section of PDA. But those exact same employees do not always appear or auto predict in the approvals section of the PDA.  I have had to request dozens of new PDA approvers. The entire active PJM staff should be uniformly available in all sections of the tool,Feature Request/Enhancement
"Currently the PDA tool currently does not work properly for the Netherlands projects, as e.g. suppliers cannot be added.",Feature Request/Enhancement
I dont understand why it has to be so complex,Feature Request/Enhancement
In order to calculate actual project margin quickly in PDA it should allow PM to input unrecoverable CBRE costs. eg. PM fees on low value projects on some Enterprise Account MSA's.,Feature Request/Enhancement
My answers above relate only to the PDA as this is the only tool I actively use. We have used plans pro it is a useful tool but do not use it regularly enough to provide feedback. This survey seems like a good idea however it should I think include a selection of questions for each platform.  ,Feature Request/Enhancement
The Tool is clunky - There should be more drop down options,Feature Request/Enhancement
"I am not a core user of the PDA tool, but I have looked closely at the CPP tool and the Opportunity Risks inputs.  Other users I have spoken to find that they need a lot of input and box clicking.  ",Feature Request/Enhancement
to improve navigation and data entry into the forms.,Feature Request/Enhancement
"I mostly use PDA. There are definitely some small tweaks that would improve the user experience.  I'm not talking about major change, one example would be - uploading Documents as an attachment to a J&A is limited to filenames of less than 50 characters, which is very frustrating in having to shorten file names.

"using this tool, as it is now, makes a greater risk of fails in the project, as we have to type the same info in various other places. ",Feature Request/Enhancement

"Use international date format, rather than American. ",Feature Request/Enhancement
the CCP tool is very good and could be enhanced further to include more images. It would also be good that once approved it could be dynamically updated over the life of the project with out having to reissue for further approval ,Feature Request/Enhancement
"Having using PDA, we have to select default sub contractors list available in the drop down. These default sub-contractors not suitable / not available in our region (India). There should be an option to add our sub-contractors name. ",Feature Request/Enhancement

About PDA I suggest to change/improve the approval process. In the last months it changed and now is impossible for us ask approval as the local approvers are pending or the same one cover more than one role. ,Feature Request/Enhancement
"PDA is very clunky and time consuming to use, doesn't provide any assistance as a project management tool and as a global tool ",Feature Request/Enhancement

PDA has elements which users find difficult when first using the system,Feature Request/Enhancement
ie. PDA Tool is not user friendly and require further updates.,Feature Request/Enhancement
PDA tool should automatically determine what the required DOA is after project type is chosen.  ,Feature Request/Enhancement
PDA  not necessarily setup for local market or speedy input,Feature Request/Enhancement
 Adding vendors into PDA is only done through Kahua...makes no sense. ,Feature Request/Enhancement
"Also, these tools don't populate good dashboards for clients and if anything is custom, it costs money. ",Feature Request/Enhancement
"Every account I have been on, uses these are check boxes then utilizes their own excel files/tools.",Feature Request/Enhancement
"  Most clients was a proposal ASAP, PDA process way too slow.  DOA for client contract approval, budget approval, expense contract is too many people, takes too long and needs to be streamlined ASAP.  It is taking 2 - 4 weeks from when a client gives us a PO before we can issue a PO to our vendors.  ",Feature Request/Enhancement
Can be not aligned with how a specific local market operates. ,Feature Request/Enhancement
"As an example, risk management with the Red/Yellow risks doesn't align with the Australian market.",Feature Request/Enhancement
There should be more drop down options,Feature Request/Enhancement

"Users feel that a lot of data entry is required, but that it does not appear to have purpose.  ",Feature Request/Enhancement
" The PDA tool is easy to use, except it is missing many vendors and approvers in the drop downs. ",Feature Request/Enhancement
  My recommendation for improvement would be the introduction of a QHSE only approval on the PDA. This should be linked to the CPP page so as each time a CPP is created the relevant QHSE manager is automatically send a copy for approval. ,Feature Request/Enhancement

"Users are locked out frequently requiring assistance in e-mailing service desk for unlocks and submitting new passwords, etc. Then, due to the changes in passwords, they are likely to lock themselves out again. I understand this is largely an ""end-user"" issue, but it is a recurring issue at many sites. Perhaps lowering the threshold for the password would be helpful. A 4-digit pin is easier and more manageable for technicians than intricate password requirements (which inevitably are written down in a handy location so they can remember it thus defeating any security provided by an intricate password).  Streamlining the password / unlock request process. Is it necessary to have to contact support? Could this process not be automated using the technicians e-mail or other two factor authentication? This would eliminate the requirement to e-mail or call support. And theoretically (and I hate to sound like an MBA) but could cut costs for the service center or allow them to refocus their efforts to solving other issues.  Better access to associated PMs and WOs associated with assets and generated PM work orders. For me to look at the past PMs for a monthly generated work order, I have to go to the relevant WO, click on the equipment tab, click the equipment number, click on order history, then organize by date to find the older work orders. This is not intuitive, and with the limited access frontline supervisors and managers have to search, reports, and equipment detail, it is not feasible to search assets and draw relevant information, history, etc.  On-site supervisors and manager don't have adequate control over PM generation and Asset management meaning we have to submit asset changes to our SI7 manager to make relevant changes. This is time consuming and takes the control from the individuals with the knowledge need to be inserted and creating an unnecessary middle step to the process.  Last, if there was a way in which work orders could be generated real-time on a monitor, it could be incredibly helpful. For our sites that used used TMS CMMS system, when a work order was generated it would automatically print the order on the shop printer and we would immediately know that a WO had come in. It also gave us a physical copy to hand to technicians for them to read the relevant details, complete the assigned task, then enter the completion info into CMMS. A similar system, printed or perhaps displayed on a monitor in work areas would allow such real-time acknowledgment of entered orders. ",Other Issue

"First off.  VAWS is not a stand alone product, it is part of the CBRE's structure so it's hard to separate VAWs from the rest of that structure. As a vendor, I find that VAWs and the various other parts of CBRE that I have to navigate are overly complex and segmented.  Work orders often have missing or inaccurate basic information such as a site contact and description.  The not to exceed values are very low and waste time quoting fairly basic work that may exceed these low amounts.  Work orders are often unnecessarily delayed in getting to vendors.  The very limited specific reasons that can be used to extend work orders is a frustrating waste of time.  OTSR work orders need to be dealt with in a different way than other work orders which is confusing and often causes delays.  VAWs seems to function as a confusing wall between vendors, clients and CBRE staff rather than a convenient way to connect us.  The system used by WSI was much simpler, more effective and efficient.",Technical Issue

"There should be a flow chart that provides an in-depth explanation of processing. There is more to VAWS than ""how to put in a quote"" or ""how to put in an invoice."" What is the process of each work order? From time of receipt to the payment. I feel an explanation of the ""life"" of the work order would make each step we, as vendors, have to complete make more sense. The handbook we were given 4 years ago is very outdated, included the codes for each status. What does each status actually mean to the vendor? For example, ""CPW- order closed, awaiting paperwork"" sounds like we need to submit an invoice however, if the work order is waiting for work verification we cannot invoice. Another issue that is quite tumultuous is once we submit a quote, the work order disappears. We lost the ability to view and track it. Therefore, we are left to track it on our own which is counterintuitive when you have a system tracking ""all"" work orders. VAWS is also lacking financial transparency.

"The system did not mesh with the work we did in almost no way whatsoever.  We had worked with UPS for almost 20 years without any issues ever until CBRE came along and threw a giant ass monkey wrench in the whole thing.  Micromanaging the hell out of certain types of vendors does NOT work.  We worked independently with UPS corporate, regional, and local CBM's for years without issue.  The nature of our work did not interfer with operations but was totally ancillary to their business as it related to environmental permit compliance work which basically had nothing to do with their daily business operations yet the work needed to be completed quarterly.  Thus we operated independently to help assist and keep them in compliance.  We ususally notified folks of when we would be onsite, but much of the work was weather dependent and not able to be scheduled in advance and thus we went onsite when we needed to be there.  We had first hand working relationships with many folks onsite including all CBMs, and regional PE folks, down to many of the mechanics at the shops.  People knew us by name and many times called us directly for assistance.  Having to go through CBRE as a third party was nothing but a giant pain in the ass that provided no additional help for anyone.  Now for local housekeeping contracts or something like that where the workers are hourly low wage then a third party manager makes sense.  For us a highly educated professionals who performed very specific tasks that CBRE did not understand in way it was nothing but a hassle.  Before we worked directly with out clients on both work and invoicing issues.  Having to go through the VAWS system only costs us lots of extra time and effort that did not benefit the client in any way and led to us greatly having to increase our prices to justify the hassle.  In the end we no longer do work for our clients who utilze CBRE because it was not worth the hassle and the corporate fat cats in charge signed a global contract with another global corporation.  In the end this did not help the clients compliance with their permits and compliance status with the States.  We had worked hard to develop a compliance system that worked and it kept our clients in compliance with the permits from EPA and State regulatory bodies.  CBRE came along and basically ruined it all.  So I hope you guys are happy with yourselves.  You need to stick with specific business segments that you know such as housekeeping and building maintenance contracts.  When it comes to other highly specific compliance activities you should leave it to other experts in the field.  ",Training needed

This is very frustrating when you've already input numerous line items. ",Usability Issue
The system is too difficult to navigate and submit invoices.  Too many steps involved for a simple process.  The excel exports take forever to pull even for a simple report.

"The thing I dislike the most about fmPilot is when I am putting together a larger quote. I have to pay attention to the time and click save every 5-10 minutes. I have had on multiple occasions where ive put together very large bids taking me over 30+ minutes and when i go to save it will like time out and ill loose everything from my quote and have to start over completely. The next thing i dislike is when I invoice a job, we have to wait for pending verification. Even though i have the invoice completed and submitted. I feel like if our invoice is already done, we shouldnt have to go back in again after verification status is complete, just to change the status again for our invoices submittal. When im done with a job, i invoice it and when the store verifies. That should be it, I shouldn't have to go change status again to submit our invoice. I forget about this all the time and it causes us more days waiting to be paid for our work. Or if we already have a signed work order, why do we have to wait up to 3 more days for the store to verify the work is done? If a Manager signed our work order, isn't that already verifying the works been complete? My last complaint would be when i get a work order with a DNE on it. I go out and look at the job to inspect and verify what all is needed to complete the scope. I dont get a MOD to sign the work order at that time, as i have the intent of doing the job. However, their have been times where i complete an inspection and get back to my office. I run the numbers for labor and material, realize i need a DNE increase and submit a quote. My quote doesnt get approved and i invoice for incurred. Then the invoice gets kicked back because i dont have a signed work order, this has happened at least 5-6 times. I dont think i should have to get a signature on a work order when we dont complete the scope thats detailed on the work order. I also shouldnt have to drive back out to a property for a signature, just for the cost of 1 trip charge. We have had to do this before as well and its more of a pain and takes more time to deal with it then what our trip charge is worth. I think a different way to invoice for our incurred trip charges should be available and they shouldn't require a signed work order either. ",Usability Issue

This should include easy access to each field, previous invoices, and should not be separated in small blocks without even a full screen (why is the screen a small square in my screen?) There should be an obvious field for invoice submission, & for the Invoice Number, and amounts. I mean to create an invoice you select ""submit invoice"", so how do you submit the invoice once it has been created? I submit each invoice at least 4 times.... You have to search for each field and good luck getting back the next time. Try separating the dispatch/work from the final invoice submission.

"I'm not sure how this can be improved. On the Vendor's side it's definitely easier to just talk to our contact directly, and set up the work orders on our own system. Now we have to do both. One in our system and one in the Vendor program. Many companies are switching to vendor programs and they're all different, so we have to learn each one. It's time consuming to say the least.","Usability Issue,Training Needed"

"Fix the issues:  Putting a quote in is very frustrating. It times out and you have to start over.  It is constantly losing information and you have to restart the program. Not user friendly at all. There are too many reasons I am dissatisfied with this program. There is noone to call when there is a problem, very poor tech support. Slow to correct any problems and most of the time they are not corrected.","Usability Issue,Training Needed"

I need to get my own account. We use one account per branch. ,
There is a delay the invoices being paid to showing ticket closed. ,
Make the reporting feature more user friendly.  ,
Add simple highlighted tabs for when. a folder has a notification.,
My only issue is with calling into the IVR system.,
needs to be more user friendly and easier to navigate ,
Make it easier for Vendors to run reports. ,
Make it easier to use,
How about not putting Survey everytime we open the app?,
"Train staff better to know that PM services are a flat rate when we invoice them. We received 3 invoice rejections this morning, when we have been invoicing them the same way for years. This cuts into other work our office staff needs to be focused on and is extremely frustrating. Also, if there is a SOW or checklist for any jobs, please make sure they are attached to the job instead of asking us to provide a checklist we don't have.",
Continue to be able to be more user friendly,
glitches with changing processes and unit values under manual entry.,
Modernize UI.,
The sensitivity of using the IVR can be complicating when clocking in & out. It doesn't allow much time to enter information and I receive a lot of error messages causing to change the status manually,
It would be nice to be able to export data for quotes submitted.   Also would be nice for suppliers to be able to run a KPI scorecard.,
make easier for technicians to check in and out,
By not adding DNE so that techs see it,
Make it more user friendly and easier to get someone on the phone or email back quicker,
"When we get a direct deposit of more than one job, please give us the breakdown of which jobs the money went to.",
"Just simple things, like if I upload photos before I change a ticket status to submitting invoice. Then I get an error because I wasn't actually in the invoice tab when I uploaded the photos. I have to re upload one of the same photos that I just sent, in order for the status to change and invoice to submit.  I wish there was an easier option for signed work orders. So many times either I forget or my technicians forget. A lot of properties are an hour plus away, so to drive back out for a signature can be a pain, if the store isn't able to scan or send us a copy.  Lastly, being we have so many steps that we have to follow in order to accept, change statuses, pending verifications. & invoicing. I think the customer should have some responsibilities as well. Mostly, I feel they should have to upload at least 1 photo of whatever the tickets issue or repair request is. A lot of times, If we would have just had a photo. We could have sent the right tech, or materials, or been more prepared to complete the task. We would have a much faster completion rate on the majority of work orders. If we just had some photos to prep us before arriving to the property.",
"application is very slow, takes a while to load workorders.",
the manual submission process is extremely time consuming.  If this was my only 3rd party or account that would be ok but its not...  maybe prepopulate the next box?  or less time between processes.  As well the Bulk Upload is NOT user friendly.  had a really hard time getting it to work. from what i understand that system has never been revamped.  If i have a vote please revamp.  I would use it for all 4 clients i have ,
"I use it because its mandatory, but not necessary for what I do- used to it now, but not user friendly. I need to get WO numbers from here, but lately they haven't been available on time",
FM Pilot is highly useful and well formatted for occasional use. But for snow removal very difficult to use in the field. Snow is unpredictable and FM Pilot requires the stores to make requests at very short notice and don't always have the ability to go through FM Pilot leaving us with no actual work order prior to work being completed. Requests are made by the store either by text or phone calls. ,
It's sometimes difficult to get a response to questions.,
Improve reporting. Improve charts and functionality. Improve technical aspects. Improve flow of information from vendors and clients to platform,
"Make it more vendor friendly. It is very ""corporate""",
IT IS SOMEWHAT CONFUSING USING THIS PROGRAM SIMPLYFLYING THE TABS AND MAKING IT MORE USER FRIEDNLY ,
Technical issues: ex. The vendor is not on site - we are there. ,
Im good with it,
