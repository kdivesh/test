Finance & Accounting,"Users are locked out frequently requiring assistance in e-mailing service desk for unlocks and submitting new passwords, etc. Then, due to the changes in passwords, they are likely to lock themselves out again. I understand this is largely an ""end-user"" issue, but it is a recurring issue at many sites. Perhaps lowering the threshold for the password would be helpful. A 4-digit pin is easier and more manageable for technicians than intricate password requirements (which inevitably are written down in a handy location so they can remember it thus defeating any security provided by an intricate password).  Streamlining the password / unlock request process. Is it necessary to have to contact support? Could this process not be automated using the technicians e-mail or other two factor authentication? This would eliminate the requirement to e-mail or call support. And theoretically (and I hate to sound like an MBA) but could cut costs for the service center or allow them to refocus their efforts to solving other issues.  Better access to associated PMs and WOs associated with assets and generated PM work orders. For me to look at the past PMs for a monthly generated work order, I have to go to the relevant WO, click on the equipment tab, click the equipment number, click on order history, then organize by date to find the older work orders. This is not intuitive, and with the limited access frontline supervisors and managers have to search, reports, and equipment detail, it is not feasible to search assets and draw relevant information, history, etc.  On-site supervisors and manager don't have adequate control over PM generation and Asset management meaning we have to submit asset changes to our SI7 manager to make relevant changes. This is time consuming and takes the control from the individuals with the knowledge need to be inserted and creating an unnecessary middle step to the process.  Last, if there was a way in which work orders could be generated real-time on a monitor, it could be incredibly helpful. For our sites that used used TMS CMMS system, when a work order was generated it would automatically print the order on the shop printer and we would immediately know that a WO had come in. It also gave us a physical copy to hand to technicians for them to read the relevant details, complete the assigned task, then enter the completion info into CMMS. A similar system, printed or perhaps displayed on a monitor in work areas would allow such real-time acknowledgment of entered orders. ","data issue, Feature request",,

I have had on multiple occasions where ive put together very large bids taking me over 30+ minutes and when i go to save it will like time out and ill loose everything from my quote and have to start over completely. The next thing i dislike is when I invoice a job, we have to wait for pending verification. Even though i have the invoice completed and submitted. I feel like if our invoice is already done, we shouldnt have to go back in again after verification status is complete, just to change the status again for our invoices submittal. When im done with a job, i invoice it and when the store verifies. That should be it, I shouldn't have to go change status again to submit our invoice. I forget about this all the time and it causes us more days waiting to be paid for our work. Or if we already have a signed work order, why do we have to wait up to 3 more days for the store to verify the work is done? If a Manager signed our work order, isn't that already verifying the works been complete? My last complaint would be when i get a work order with a DNE on it. I go out and look at the job to inspect and verify what all is needed to complete the scope. I dont get a MOD to sign the work order at that time, as i have the intent of doing the job. However, their have been times where i complete an inspection and get back to my office. I run the numbers for labor and material, realize i need a DNE increase and submit a quote. My quote doesnt get approved and i invoice for incurred. Then the invoice gets kicked back because i dont have a signed work order, this has happened at least 5-6 times. I dont think i should have to get a signature on a work order when we dont complete the scope thats detailed on the work order. I also shouldnt have to drive back out to a property for a signature, just for the cost of 1 trip charge. We have had to do this before as well and its more of a pain and takes more time to deal with it then what our trip charge is worth. I think a different way to invoice for our incurred trip charges should be available and they shouldn't require a signed work order either. ","Performance, Usability",,

I have most trouble with comments and email integration, navigating work order groups, having multiple tabs of fmPilot open at once confusing actions, performing bulk actions, and generally glitches and latency issues throughout the site.","Usability, Performance, Bug","Desktop, mobile",Neutral
Facility Coordinator,"There's a lot to learn about SI7. It has a lot of perks and just as many glitches. I'm a computer savvy person and it's still a difficult application for me to navigate. I will say, like with anything, the more time invested using the app the easier its become to manage. This is in direct response to the difficulty of SI7.   The app doesn't populate everything that is requested. I often have to hit refresh on the browser when i bring up my call list because it doesn't bring up all of my WOs. I've entered a CAS to create a PO and the PO doesn't generate in coupa. Just things like that would help if they were cleaned up. Maybe streamline the app better. Make a GUI for each level of clearance as far as access to the app. So a tech's GUI would look different than an FM/FC. Not just making the links inaccessible.

Customer Service Rep,"Better, faster, more flexible interface. This version needs to be scratched and updated. Not fun dealing with CBRE employees. It leaves a bland, bad taste in the mouth. ","Usability, Process","languages, login",Neutral
Facility Manager,"It would be better if we could contact someone easier when something happens.  Also, The system isn't very user friendly.  It should have more warning pop ups when something is missing or different.  Thank you.","Usability, Process","PM, job steps",Negative
Technician,Make it easier to communicate with support / AP / team leaders etc.,"Usability, Process",,Negative
Facility Manager,Payment processing is a massive inconvenience. All the options to choose from or not user-friendly. There is no updates when something has changed other than through your email please hinder and cost us valuable time.,"Usability, Process","WO, search, quicklist",Negative
Facility Manager,Too difficult to move around....have to click on too many things just to approve or reject items.  Response time is slow.,"Usability, Process","WO, locations",Neutral
Technician,Use a usable UI. Also most calls come in at 1 o'clock and we are 2 hours from going into overtime already.,"Usability, Process",login,Negative
Facility Manager,"Use is not intuitive. Often comments, etc. appear to be minimal or non-existent. We shouldn't have to struggle to know what's going on with a ticket. Updates are not sent to anyone on the clinic side.  We get no notification of creation of WO, changes to WO, etc.    Uploaded documents (backflow preventer documentation, fire extinguisher, etc..) should be automatically forwarded to someone within the clinic. Often these are uploaded weeks after we open tickets and we never see them if we don't remember to go back and check.  Even searching for past tickets can be difficult and frustrating as there are far too many categories of information that we have no knowledge of.","Usability, Process","PM, WO",Negative
Facility Manager,"Direct every request for my team directly to me. Skip the FC, and FM. It sits in their queue at times . Lost time I need to meet SLA.","Usability, role permission","Reporting, tickets",Neutral
Technician,I'm unable to view just my current and past requests. The website shows every request from other users as well. ,"Usability, role permission","iMFM, WO",Neutral
Facility Coordinator,Make it easier to search for work orders and make it easier to add users.,"Usability, Role Permission","vendor, search, job plans, competitors",Negative
Technician,the options within the portal don't align with some of the requests needed here on site. i have to select drop downs that don't apply and then provide specific directions within the comments section. ,"Usability, role permission","mobile, PO",Negative
Client/Customer,"ServiceInsight is a powerful tool.  At the technician level, efficiency and ease of use should be the priority.  In many cases technicians are now spending a portion of their time entering data to Si7.  The goal should be to minimize data entry time and maximize wrench time.  Allow administrators and managers to retain the very powerful tools that are available in Si7.  I would go at it like Nest did with the thermostat.  No one thought thermostats needed to be changed.  Nest approached it with simplicity in mind and it revolutionized thinking about how people interact with a product. ","Usability, role permission, data issue","login, client",Negative
Technician,I would like to see the mobile MFM app have more streamlined controls for the tech in the field. ,"Usability, role permission, Feature request",,N/A
Facility Manager,"The tools is not friendly user.  It has archaic graphics, complicated search tool,  hard to find what we need.  Many times my team and I want to update a WO and we end asking for help in our organization because the tool does not provide the right access we need.    We are not allowed to integrate new PM schedules and always depend on others, but the response time is always more than a month.  Our productivity has depleted with this tool and the client prefer not to use it, since they never can't allocate their WO in the right field.","Usability, support, data issue","WO, Attachments",Neutral
Technician,"We also use VAWS a part of the Service Insights suite.  The tool is useful because it is what we have. However, I have experienced some difficulties with the setup/configurations. For instance, the Set G/L-subledger.  Also, accessing some of the actions through tabs and others through grids.  A person could miss that all together.  I have submitted several enhancement requests and can't wait to hear the results. ","Usability, support, data issue",WO,N/A
System Administrator,fmPilot is not user friendly to get started. Once you learn everything it seems easier.,"Usability, Training",,Negative
Technician,"For the majority of users SI7 is too clunky. For a system that is supposed to be widely used by site population, training should not be required.   There are too many drop downs menus (maintenance category) that ultimately mean little to the end user. For the most part, almost all of the requests at my sites go to the same people, so why do all of the selecting?  At my sites you select address and then the next selection is something like all rooms. Why have the category?  Thanks for reviewing my feedback.","Usability, training",,Neutral
Facility Manager,"Make it more USER FRIENDLY.   The facilities have difficulty finding the correct coding to enter NON EMER work orders.  Some of the codes the support center uses all the time are not available to them...so they enter just about everything as General Maint, --which is not good.   Give the facilities instruction, easy instruction on how to use it.   That would make support center staff work easier instead of having to fix the mistakes of others before service is rendered.  ","Usability, Training",,Positive
System Administrator,"Not for me, but for contractors I do business with. They need more help navigating the system/portal.","Usability, training","MyBuy, WO, PO, JDE, vendor",Negative
Facility Manager,"Service insight portal: The site is not intuitive at all. I really don`t like to use it. To open a WO is very confusing and I don`t know one single person in my contract that uses it. Public export filters need some extra knowledge to use them. Quick list filters need to be exactly accurate with the data we want, otherwise, they won't appear","Usability, training","WO, assets, mobile, PM, job steps",Negative
Facility Manager,Stop making it so you have to do so many steps to submit an invoice.  Why do we have to submit an invoice and type it in. Seems redundant. Shouldn't have to have training to learn how to use this system.,"Usability, Training",,N/A
Client/Customer,You may have a way of doing this that I don't know about. Let's say I have a pm ID for air fan. Well that ID for that all the air fans in the building are the same. I can't get SI7 to assign the af on one floor to one tech and assign another af to a different tech automaticly. I have to send all af to myself and then assign them to my techs. Waste a lot of time.,"Usability, training, Feature request",Request,Negative
Facility Manager,"There are way too many buttons and options and the program should be simplified for the type of WO and or the role. There are multiple ways to do similar things on SI and it makes it complicated. training is terrible or non existent and it is one of the main programs used a CBRE. I receive more training on how to use a ladder, which I never use that I have with Service  Insight. ","Usability, training, role permission","contractors, vendor",Negative
